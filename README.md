This is a prototype "app" made at Gothenburg startup hack (gbgstartuphack.se).

Latent Dirichlet Allocation was used to find topics in song lyrics for over 5000 songs. The user can then search for songs and view both the lyrics and the most interesting results from the LDA algorithm. The user can also see other songs that is about the same topics as the current song.

To run the app, run the main class in the gui-package.

OBS: The code is a bit messy due to the limitation of 10 hours hacking during the startup hack. Future plan is to organize the code better and to make a Spotify app out of it. Future planned additions:

- Analysis of artists. What does a specific artist generally sing about?

- What artists steal the most lyrics.

- Be able to search for songs given a specified list of topics.

- Number of unique words used by a specific artist.
