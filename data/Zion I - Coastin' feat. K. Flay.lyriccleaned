life
brings
trouble
fight
run
struggle
Relax
watch
float
coastin
coastin
dream
coastin
one
set
trip
car
jets
west
drift
cliff
sunset
rest
windows
breathin
deep
chest
feel
hopeless
feel
rare
Seats
lean
chair
eyes
reflectin
sky
feel
divine
givin
alive
Cuz
days
Sleepless
nights
tryna
glide
Wind
sails
toast
ocean
balance
scales
