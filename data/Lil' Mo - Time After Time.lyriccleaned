Lying
bed
hear
clock
tick
Caught
circles
confusion
nothin
Flashbacks
warm
nights
left
Suitcase
memories
time
time
picture
walking
ahead
calling
hear
slow
fall
hand
unwinds
lost
Time
time
fall
catch
waiting
Time
time
lost
Time
time
fall
catch
waiting
Time
time
picture
fades
darkness
gray
Watchin
windows
wondering
Secrets
stolen
deep
inside
Deep
inside
drum
beats
time
lost
Time
