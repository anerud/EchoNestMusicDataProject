Seether is a post-grunge/alternative metal band which formed in Pretoria, South Africa in 1999. The band currently consists of Shaun Morgan (vocals, guitar), Dale Stewart (bass, vocals) and John Humphrey (drums). The band has released six albums and is currently signed to Wind-Up Records in the United States.  Early days, Fragile, Disclaimer  The band was originally called Saron Gas, but changed their name to Seether.  Saron Gas had their origins in Johannesburg, a city of South Africa, and the earliest days of the group saw their public appearances at parties, nightclubs, small-scale concerts and University venues, such as the University of Cape Town and the University of Stellenbosch, where they played for the lunch-time crowds in the Neelsie centre on the latter campus as late as the summer of 2001.  As Saron Gas, the band released its first album, Fragile on Musketeer Records, in 2000 in South Africa. Upon achieving success on the South African music charts, Wind-up Records took an interest in Saron Gas' melodic-yet-heavy sound and signed them to the label. The band was asked to change their name due to Saron Gas being a homophone of sarin gas, a deadly nerve agent discovered (but never used in war) by Nazi Germany during World War II.[citation needed] The band changed its name to Seether in honor of Veruca Salt's song titled, "Seether".  Success and Disclaimer II  After Disclaimer was released, the band went on a non-stop touring route in hopes of boosting sales and name recognition. Upon completing the tour, the band had planned to go into the studio and record their second release. However, they were instead tapped to support Evanescence on a worldwide tour that postponed their recording plans by almost a year. On this tour, the band reworked the acoustic ballad "Broken" into an electric ballad and had Amy Lee of Evanescence share vocal duties with Morgan during live performances. Inspired by the positive reaction the duet got on the road and perhaps fueled by a budding romance between Lee and Morgan, the band headed into the studio and quickly recorded an alternate version of "Broken" with Amy Lee on vocals. The song, along with a new song titled "Sold Me", was featured on the soundtrack for the 2004 film The Punisher and was massively successful, bringing the band fame in the US, the UK and Australia in particular. Morgan has stated that the hit song relates an incident where the band was subjected to what the record company wanted rather than what the band wanted. Disclaimer II, an alternate version of the original album with many of the songs remixed or re-recorded as well as eight extra tracks, was released in late 2004.  Karma and Effect, One Cold Night  In 2005, the band released their follow-up album Karma and Effect. The original title for the album was Catering to Cowards, but the band's record label instructed them to change the name. [3] "Karma and Effect" debuted at number 8 of the US Billboard 200 album charts and was certified gold in the US and Canada. The album spawned three singles, "Remedy", "Truth" and "The Gift". "Remedy" reached number 1 of the US Mainstream Rock Charts, becoming the band's first number 1 single.  Seether released an acoustic CD/DVD set titled One Cold Night, recorded on 22 February 2006 at Grape Street in Philadelphia. Morgan, who had been suffering from a stomach ailment, decided to do an acoustic performance of their set-list rather than cancel the show. Shaun has stated that the label chose to make the album without obscenities, which is the reason why "Needles" and "Burrito" are not on the album.  Guitarist departure, rehab  On June 16, 2006, it was announced via Seether's official site that lead guitarist Pat Callahan had chosen to leave the band. The exact reason for Callahan's departure is unknown, but regarding his feelings over the situation, Shaun Morgan commented:      "Um... relieved a little... actually a lot. He was the guy in the band that was always our naysayer, and he was the negative energy as far as writing. I personally have no love lost, which is weird for some reason 'cause he was my friend for four years. But when he walked out, it kinda walked out with him."[2]  Morgan went into rehab for alcoholism in August 2006, forcing the band to cancel their tour with Staind and Three Days Grace.  Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces  Morgan had claimed prior to the new album's debut that it would be more diverse than previous efforts. Its release was delayed due to the sudden suicide of Morgan's brother, Eugene Welgemoed. Produced by Howard Benson, the album finally hit the shelves on October 23, 2007.  "Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces" debuted at number 9 in the Billboard 200 album charts, selling 57,000 copies in the first week. The artwork for the album was illustrated by David Ho.  The first single, "Fake It," reached the top position in the US Mainstream Rock Charts and Modern Rock Charts, remaining on top for at least 9 weeks on both charts. It was also the theme for WWE's No Way Out 2008. Since the success of "Fake It," a second single, "Rise Above This," has been released and has reached the #1 spot on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and the top 2 with its mainstream counterpart. As of February 15, 2008, Troy McLawhorn of Dark New Day joined the band as a touring guitarist, and has since been made an official member. McLawhorn previously did a stint as Evanescence's replacement guitarist during the last leg of The Open Door tour.  To support the release of the hugely successful second single, "Rise Above This," Seether launched a tour in early 2008 that lasted for much of the year and saw them share the stage with several bands for several different legs, including Three Days Grace, Finger Eleven, Breaking Benjamin, 3 Doors Down, Skillet, Red, Papa Roach, Flyleaf, Econoline Crush, and Staind.  Shaun has also announced that with 2009 marking Seether's tenth anniversary, a new release coinciding with the anniversary has been negotiated with Wind-Up Records. It has been said to include old unreleased tracks and demos, including Saron Gas demos, but exact details are yet to be confirmed.  Seether claimed their first South African Music Award in the category "Best Rock: English" for Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces.  They also won the first MTV Africa Music Award for Best Alternative Artist.  On August 5, 2008, Seether released an iTunes Originals album that follows the pattern of previous releases in the series, featuring interviews between chosen album tracks and reworked versions of previously released songs.  The video for "Breakdown" was released on November 12 after a delay from its original October 23 scheduled release date.  In early 2009, a new song titled "No Shelter" was featured on the NCIS Official TV Soundtrack, released on February 10. Also, a cover of Wham!'s "Careless Whisper" was made available for purchase as a digital or mobile download.  Holding Onto Strings Better Left to Fray, Seether's fifth studio album  was released on May 17, 2011. According to the Country Song Songfacts the title is a paraphrase that Shaun Morgan read in a book, which he thought was an amazing visual.  They have also released a remix EP for this album, Remix EP.

Seether is a South African post-grunge/alternative metal band founded in 1999 in Pretoria. The band was originally formed under the name "Saron Gas" until renaming it to "Seether" in 2002. They are currently working for Wind-up Records and Musketeer Records. Disclaimer is their original album and major label debut. They gained mainstream popularity in 2004 with the single "Broken" which peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100, and have continued moderate success with #1 hits on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart such as "Remedy", "Fake It", and "Country Song". 

History:

Founding (2002-2003):
The band was formed in 1999 under the name "Saron Gas". In 2000, the band released an independent album called Fragile under their original name. 
Rumor in South Africa has it that Seether was eventually forced by their record company to change their name from "Saron Gas" to "Seether" following the 9/11 attacks in the US. 

Beginning and Disclaimer (2002):
In 2002, Seether launched their first official album, named Disclaimer, which earned the band three singles: "Fine Again", "Driven Under" and "Gasoline", in which only the first managed some repercussion. The year 2002 was very trendy for Seether. After the release of the Disclaimer, the band never stopped touring. When near the end of Disclaimer Tour, the band decided to return to the studio to record their second album, a project that had to be delayed by almost a year, since at that time Seether was on world tour with Evanescence. "Fine Again" is also in the video game Madden NFL 2003 and 1080 Avalanche. 

Success and Disclaimer II (2003-2004):
Following the release of Disclaimer, the band toured continually in order to increase sales and name recognition. A planned second album was delayed for nearly a year when Seether was selected as the support act for an Evanescence worldwide tour. Seether reworked their acoustic ballad, "Broken", as an electric ballad with guest vocals by Amy Lee of Evanescence. Favorable audience response led the band to record the revised version, with Lee on vocals. The track, along with a new song entitled "Sold Me", was featured on the soundtrack for the 2004 film, The Punisher, and became a major success for the band, particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. A romance developed between Lee and Morgan during this time. 
Morgan has stated that the song is based on an incident in which the band was subjected to the wishes of the record company, rather than those of the band. An alternate version of the original album, with many of its songs remixed or rerecorded, was released in late 2004 and entitled Disclaimer II. The alternate version also featured eight extra tracks. 

Karma and Effect, One Cold Night (2005-2006):
The band's follow-up album, Karma and Effect, was released in 2005. Originally titled Catering to Cowards, the name was changed at the record label's demand. "Karma and Effect" debuted at number 8 on the US Billboard 200 album charts, and was certified gold in the US and Canada. The album spawned three singles, "Remedy", "Truth" and "The Gift". "Remedy" reached number 1 on the US Mainstream Rock Charts, Seether's first number 1 hit. 
Seether released an acoustic CD/DVD set titled One Cold Night, recorded at Grape Street, in Philadelphia, on 22 February 2006. Morgan had been suffering from a stomach ailment, and decided to do an acoustic performance of their set rather than cancel the show. The exclusion of "Needles" and "Burrito" from the album is due to the label's desire that it contain no obscenities. 
Lead guitarist Patrick Callahan's departure from the band was announced on 16 June 2006. No reason was given, but he apparently did not enjoy Seether's new material. Shaun Morgan commented: 
"Um... relieved a little... actually a lot. He was the guy in the band that was always our naysayer, and he was the negative energy as far as writing. I personally have no love lost, which is weird for some reason 'cause he was my friend for four years. But when he walked out, it kinda walked out with him."
Morgan entered a rehabilitation program for alcoholism in August 2006, which forced the band to cancel a tour with Staind and Three Days Grace. 

Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces (2007-2009):
Shaun Morgan, prior to the next album's debut, claimed that it would be more diverse than previous efforts. Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces was slated for an August release that was delayed until 23 October due to the suicide of Morgan's brother, Eugene Welgemoed. The album debuted at number 9 in the Billboard 200 album charts, and sold 57,000 copies in its first week. Its cover artwork featured "Candice the Ghost", and was illustrated by David Ho. The first single, "Fake It", reached the top position of the US Mainstream Rock Charts and Modern Rock Charts, and held that spot for at least 9 weeks on both charts. It became the theme for WWE's No Way Out (2008). "Rise Above This", written for Eugene Welgemoed, was released as a single and reached the No. 1 spot on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and No. 2 on its mainstream counterpart. The final single from the album was "Breakdown", the video of which was released on 12 November 2008 after a delay from its original 23 October scheduled release date. Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces won Seether's first South African Music Award, in the category "Best Rock: English", as well as their first MTV Africa Music Award for "Best Alternative Artist". 
A tour launched in support of the album in early 2008 lasted much of the year. Troy McLawhorn, of Dark New Day, Evanescence, Sevendust, and doubleDrive, was hired as a touring guitarist on 15 February 2008. Bands Seether shared the stage with on the tour included Three Days Grace, Finger Eleven, Breaking Benjamin, 3 Doors Down, Skillet, Red, Papa Roach, Flyleaf, Econoline Crush and Staind. McLawhorn was afterwards made an official member of the band. 
"No Shelter" appeared on the NCIS Official TV Soundtrack, released on 10 February 2009, and a version of Wham!'s "Careless Whisper" was made available for purchase as a digital or mobile download. The song was reportedly covered as a joke, in which the band turned a "Cheesy 80s pop ballad" into a Hard Rock/Metal song in response to Wind-up's request that they record a Valentine's Day song. The music video for "Careless Whisper" premiered on 15 June 2009, and the song is included as an additional track on the reissue of Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces. 
Seether supported Nickelback on their Dark Horse tour in March and April, 2009. Shaun and Dale confirmed in an interview on 2 March 2009 that, after the Nickelback tour, Seether would take the rest of year off to write and record the follow-up to Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces. The band nevertheless gave performances through the remainder of the year, which included a date in Okinawa to play for American troops as part of a USO tour on 23 and 24 May at Camp Schwab, and then in MCAS Iwakuni on 26 May for the US Marines. Seether also made appearances at a number of festivals during the summer, including sets at the Chippewa Valley Music Festival and the Quebec City Festival, before the tour's conclusion at The Big E Festival, West Springfield, MA, on 4 October. 

Holding Onto Strings Better Left to Fray (2010-2013):
The band spent several months recording in Nashville, Tennessee with producer Brendan O'Brien, then resumed touring in April 2010 with the intention of returning to the studio "in the first week of June" to complete the new record. Drummer John Humphrey confirmed in August that recording was completed, and the album was in the mixing process. He said that the band believed this album to be their best work, and that the songs are "very strong, melodic, and heavy at times." Morgan confirmed the album's completion in September, and gave the expected release date as early 2011. A new song, "No Resolution", was debuted on 4 September 2010, during a live show at the DuQuoin, IL State Fair. McLawhorn and Humphrey, in a radio interview, announced that the new album would be titled Holding Onto Strings Better Left to Fray, and that it would be released in May. The album's first single, "Country Song", was released on 8 March in the US and on 4 April in the United Kingdom, and the new album was released on 17 May 2011. Seether reached their highest position on the US Billboard 200 Charts when Holding On to Strings Better Left to Fray rose to the Number 2 position. It also reached number one on the US Rock Albums, US Alternative Albums and US Hard Rock Album Charts. Their single-week sales of 61,000 records was their best since Karma and Effect sold 82,000 copies in 2005.Billboard named Seether the No. 1 Active and No. 1 Heritage Rock Artist of 2011. A remix EP of the Holding Onto Strings Better Left to Fray album, titled Remix EP, was released on 7 February 2012. 
Troy McLawhorn's departure from the band and return to Evanescence was announced on 8 March. Seether performed live in Cincinnati, Ohio on 10 May, and in South Bend, Indiana on 11 May. Both concerts were recorded, and released as a limited edition CD set for each individual city. Seether played main stage on the Uproar Festival alongside bands Avenged Sevenfold, Three Days Grace, Bullet For My Valentine, and Escape The Fate, and supported 3 Doors Down on their European tour from November to March. 

Seether: 2002-2013 (2013):
On 3 September 2013, the band announced the name of a compilation album, titled Seether: 2002-2013. The album was released on 29 October 2013 as a 2-disc album, featuring some of Seether's greatest hits, unreleased demos, soundtrack songs and 3 all-new tracks, including a cover of Veruca Salt's "Seether" (the song that the band is named after). "Seether: 2002-2013" also contains two new recorded songs ("Safe To Say I've Had Enough" & "Weak") and was produced by Brendan O'Brien. The band released a 15-second demo clip for the song "Safe To Say I've Had Enough" on loudwire.com. The band also carried out a small, semi-acoustic tour of Europe and South Africa. 
According to sources, the band is working on their sixth studio album which is expected to release around May 2014. The album title, track listing and release date is still to be revealed. 
In a recent Twitter interview, Dale Stewart, the band's bassist, has confirmed that the band is writing songs for their upcoming album. Another confirmation that Seether is currently working on their new album, is a statement from leadsinger Shaun Morgan on the website Reddit.com which came during an AmA (askmeanything) interview, where he stated that band was "In the studio getting ready for our new album..."  
On January 31 2014, the band posted a video on their YouTube channel in which frontman Shaun Morgan stated that the album was well underway and recording should be completed in about a week (as of the video post date).  

Isolate and Medicate (2014 - present):
During a recent Twitter interview, John Humphrey, the band's drummer, stated that the upcoming album is due for a summer release. More details about the new album will be announced in "the next month or so".  
Seether's new record is rumored to be called "Isolate and Medicate" with a due release date of July 1st, 2014 on Banshee Records. 

Musical style and influences:
Seether are heavily influenced by American grunge groups such as Nirvana and Alice in Chains. Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote "Seether's lead singer/songwriter, Shaun Morgan, is an unabashed, unapologetic worshiper of Kurt Cobain, using Nirvana's sound as a template for Seether". Seether have also been influenced by Deftones and Nine Inch Nails.
