Can I graduate
Can I graduate
Can I look in faces that I meet
Can I get my punk ass off the street
I've been living on for so long
Can I graduate
To the bastard talking down to me
Your whipping boy calamity
Cross your fingers, I'm going to knock it all down
Can I graduate
Echo fading we can't let go
She goes walking by in slow mo'
