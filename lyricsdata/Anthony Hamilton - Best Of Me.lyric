It's simple, I love it
Having you near me, having you here
Our conversations, Outrageous
you smile, then I smile then I say
ooohhh- this is getting personal, personal, personal
Lets stay for a while, and play, girl lets make this a moment
oohhhh

Giving you the best of me. Amazing, Amazing ooohh
having you close to me, Amazing, Outrageous
give your best to me

Good Morning,
...
