I walk along the city streets you used to walk along with me
And every step I take reminds me of just how we used to be

Well how can I forget you girl,
When there is always something there to remind me?
Always something there to remind me.

As shadows fall I pass the small cafe where we would dance at night.
And I can't help recalling how it how it felt to kiss and hold you tight.
