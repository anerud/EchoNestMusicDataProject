Consumed with memories that preceded today
Given a chance to bereave life that's slipping away

Suffered through tragedy of my slow decay
Deceptive tendencies dragged my soul away

All that I know there was no god for me
Force that shatters all, absence of mortality

Revive all my fears
Revive wasted tears
