Persuaded, paraded, inebriated and down
Still aware of everything life carries on without
'Cause there's one too many faces with dollar sign smiles
I got to find the shortest path to the bar for a while

A long way from happiness
In a three hour away town
Whiskey bottle over Jesus
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, but just for now
