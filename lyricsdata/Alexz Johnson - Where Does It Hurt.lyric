Where does it hurt?
Tell me 'cause I understand
The words of a heart
Beating like wings in my head
We can't hide
We'll never lie
I'll always see into you

There's nothing wrong
With coming up empty and cold
Staying too long
And trying to turn rocks into gold
I've been there too
I've wasted myself
And you were there for me

So whenever you crash
Wherever you land
That's where I'll be

And for every endless midnight
...
