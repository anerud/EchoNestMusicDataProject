I stand before thee, gods of all prestine
Come forth to see, all things to be seen
Now know the presence, and choose thy wrath
For flock of tyrants, who know not thy path

Come now in sweeping vengeance
Come now in needed time
I demand as I stand before you
Cleanse this worlds decay

I demand to know the light of a promised land
I demand to see this corrosion wiped away

And the slithering begins
as the shell of men crawl weeping
...
