I want you to remember
A love so full it could send us always
I want you to surrender
All my feelings rose today

And I want you to remain
The power of children can amaze
I'll try not to complain
I know that's a pisser baby

The chemicals between us
The walls that lie between us
Lying in this bed
The chemicals displaced
There is no lonelier state
Than lying in this bed
