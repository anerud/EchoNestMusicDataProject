Gonna tell you a story,
where does love go, where does love go, baby.
say you wanna find love in her.
listen love, listen closely,
so i'll tell you something.
I've been thinking to myself, what the hell i did wrong.
always in a relationship that, that never last long.
let me tell you a little story, about someone i met.
a situation so trifling that, that i'd never forget.
So i met this girl and, she seemed so right.
i got so caught up by, what was on outside.
as time went on, i really got to know.
that the girl i thought was an angel, was nuttin' but a hoe.
my homie tried to warn me, but i was too caught up.
i started tripping on my best friend, i told him shut the fuck up.
i said "you don't know what yer talkin' 'bout, this girl loves me."
but as quiet as kept, she was lovin' everybody else.
Can't somebody tell me where the love goes from here.
somebody now tell me now, baby.
cause i can't seem to find true love no more.
i can't seem to find baby,
can't somebody tell me where the love goes from here.
cause i can't seem to find true love and peace of mind.
Listen to this,
...
