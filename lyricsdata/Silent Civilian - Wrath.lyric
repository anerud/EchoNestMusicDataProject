Fell on dear ears
Sacrificed someone elses freedom
To be heard
Destroy careless
For the greed of a child bearing
One mans name, his name

Holding on to what they said
Creates a path to our destruction
Breathing life into whats dead
Ignore the wrath of our dysfunction

Tortured victim
Circumstance of a system downfall
...
