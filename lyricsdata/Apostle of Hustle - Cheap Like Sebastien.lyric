The smallest truth is the brightest
A tiny undeniable fire
The smallest truth is found hiding
You're scared but you're not a liar

You cheat like Sebastien
You cheat like Sebastien
You cheat like Sebastien

My life is desperate and private
I'm reckless there's one thing I can keep
I spent that weekend in Niagara Falls
It was new, it was love, it was cheap
