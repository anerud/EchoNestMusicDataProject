[Del]
Del meister, bout to heist the hijacking, come back
Listen to this, peep it

The transfixer, reprimand your bland fixtures
Replenishing with my menacing sentencing
Up inside this, oblige with guidance
From the funk expanding verb triton
I glance upon the multitudes of weak and seek
To organization concentration camps so they can get lobotimized
Fuck so bad, you feel sodomized
Time for words to be colonized
To keep regards tall in size
Erecting the best things in life
My flows composed of foe-sas
My enemies cheese in my face and embrace my palm
I hella spurn, but my face is calm
Keeping the hip-hop scene vibrant
I come alive with good tide, it's fine, and MC's silent
Milestones in Hiero history
Led you wishin' we was never released, at least
Even if our demo tapes add to the myth of Hiero's gifts
Those that don't agree is just pleading the Fifth
Proceeding to enscript the code
that makes your brain overload and implode
Too much imagination got you facing defeat
Quit rhyming cause to wasting the beat
It's Del with my diabolical follow-ups
And logged to augmentated tales that keep you mind tensing
With interest, and that was just an entrance
