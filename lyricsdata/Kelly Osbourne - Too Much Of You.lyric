What can I say
You got me good
Swallowed me up
Spit me out
Got me hooked

What can I do
But play the fool
And wait around for you to come
You never do

So I'll sit for days
Imagining the different ways

'Cause I love it in the morning
It's like a new day dawning
Every time baby
Too much of you is not enough
I want it in the evening
You give a whole new meaning
