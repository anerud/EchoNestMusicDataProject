(Inspectah Deck)
Yo, yo, late night, her click deserted
Time is perfect, she worth it
Femme fetale, pussy cat growl like Eartha Kitt
The first kiss, took my heart and nursed it
Looked her deep into the eyes, she realized beneath the surface
Infatuated lip servant, black afrodeziat
Cat walked across the floor, her bedroom eyes glanced back
She posed with the Playboy pose, centerfold body rose through her clothes
my love joves rose, the stereo blow, scenario
the lights slow, the hydros rose, 2 totes without the nympho
We went slow, romantic interlude in the nude
Soul Food, dinner for 2, private interview
Silent moans whisper, the bed's bound to break
Pretty brown face, I thought I felt the ground shake
The sound of the rain against the window pane
drove her insane, her wild heart has now been tamed
Got half a blunt flipped in the train, waitin to inhale
