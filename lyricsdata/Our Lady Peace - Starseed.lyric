If I let go of the world that I was holding
a passenger that could not fly
in search of souls
in search of something
let it go
let it slide

yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
ooh oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

when i find out what went on
I'll bring it back
but it won't be easy
they won't believe how a man
he could drown
in a starseed, starseed
