They tell me you're a shy boy
But I want you just the same
Don't play innocent with me
You know it's not just fun and games
When I look into your eyes
So much passion burns inside
But if you need some coaxing
I will do it
Step by step there's nothing to it

1-2-3-4 come on baby say you love me
5-6-7 times
8-9-10-11 I'm just gonna keep on counting
Until you are mine

Come out of your shell, boy
