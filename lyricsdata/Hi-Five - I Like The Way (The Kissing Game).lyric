All summer long we've been together
And I never felt so good
Cuz when I'm with you
It's such a good time (yes it is)
And when you get next to me
You make my heart beat fast
You throw me back when you smile
And when we're alone
I know we're in love
Cuz I can't get enough, cuz

(I like the way)
You kiss me when we're playing the kissing game
(I like the way)
You keep me looking forward to another day

We've got it good
