A silly girl, I run around
And never know my reasons
And though you're laughing with me
I know what you say about me

I can't explain
It's not your business anyway
So don't say you understand
And don't pretend you're on my side

And I remember when you hated her
For sleeping next to him
I see your smiling face
...
