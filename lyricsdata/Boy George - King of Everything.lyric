Put down the booze
Let the demons win the fight
Dropped my gloves to the ground
You know I'm sorry
For the times I made you cry
I made an art of letting you down

I used to say
It's only me I'm hurting
But I saw you on the stairs
The kid was crying
And the dogs were howling
And a siren filled the air

What's the word on the street
Have I lost my crown
Or will I be king again
What's the word on the street
Have I lost my crown
...
