Barcelona barcelona
barcelona barcelona
viva
I had this perfect dream
-un sueno me envolvio
this dream was me and you
-tal vez estas aqui
i want all the world to see
-un instinto me guiaba
a miracle sensation
my guide and inspiration
now my dream is slowly coming true
The wind is a gentle breeze
-el me hablo de ti
the bells are ringing out
-el canto vuela
