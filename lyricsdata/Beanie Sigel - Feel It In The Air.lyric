I can feel it in the air
My spider senses is tinglin'
Feel somethin', got my radars up

Somethin' goin' on, I feel funny
Can't tell me nuttin' different, my nose twitchin'
Intuition settin' in like steel vision
I still close my eyes, I still see visions

Still hear that voice in tha back of my mind
So what I do? I still take heathe, I still listen
I still paint that perfect picture
I still shine bright like a prism

My words still skippin' thru air, I know you cant, don't, won't get it
You niggas chose to ride that shit, 'sault wit it?
I'm still afloat, I ain't tha captain of tha yatch
But I'm on a boat, I ain't actin' what I'm not, knowin' that I don't

You niggas actin' like you will
But I know you won't, you won't
I read between tha lines of ya eyes to ya brows
Ya handshake ain't matchin' ya smile, you niggas foul

I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can hear it in your voice
I can feel it in the air
