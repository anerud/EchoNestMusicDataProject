You are the prince of charm
Seduction is your art
You'll never play my love
You're just my king of hearts
You are my king of hearts
If you're winning
You might as well admit it
And you can come and get it
Or you can just forget it, forget it
If you're winning
You might as well admit it
And you can come and get it
Or you can just forget it, forget it
You are the prince of charm
Seduction is your art
You'll never play my love
