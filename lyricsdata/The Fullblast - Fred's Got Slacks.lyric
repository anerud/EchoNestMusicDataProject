Feeling helpless once again but you would never notice it.
It'd been too long for you to care.
I love you you but it's time to say goodbye, it's time to start again.
I'm sure our paths will cross in time.
So i'll see you then.

It can't be you and me together now.
I can't find it in myself to care anymore.
