The fires inside us tonight
These bridges will burn so bright
Tomorrow bears our name
No more power games

Reaching for the light beyond
We will rise through the dark again
Ready to fight for what
We believe to be right
Yesterday is dead and gone

Rattling the chains
Shaking the cage
Heed our war cry
Let there be no doubt
We want out
This is reckoning day

We are standing in the flames
...
