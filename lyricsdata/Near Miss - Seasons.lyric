Look for comfort now, within these walls
For all these different days yeah, these autumn ways
Will slowly disappear
Will slowly fall apart
Drifting slowly, drifting clear

And all I want is, a little heart
A different point of view yeah, a different start
No time for feeling old
No time for feeling blue
