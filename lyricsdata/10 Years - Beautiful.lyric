Beauty over wisdom to fit in with their styles
Cinderella stories for a price
Vanity's a business built to fleece the unique
Silicone and stars collide, the rest will fall in line

Just as beautiful as you are
It's so pitiful what you are
You should have see this coming
All along

Visually you're stimulating to my eyes
