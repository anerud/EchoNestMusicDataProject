Riggidy-Bow, Ziggidy Gadzuks, Here I go, so
Fliggedy-flame on, g-geronimo, yo
I biggedy-burn riggedy-rubber when I blabber great
I miggedy-make the Wonder Twins deactivate
It's crazy, I'm biggedy-breakin' backs and bustin' lips
I friggedy-freaked Gladys Knight and those freakin' Pips
Shrimps, I miggedy-make enough noise like Bamm-Bamm
Throw boulders from Bedrock you'll get dropped, I slam man
So check it
I riggedy-wreck it quick, aw shucks
I giddedy-got the big ducks like Daddy Warbucks
Bohanna
I riggedy-rocked the coca-cabana
Banana split
{HACK-THO} Spit, so sit
I friggedy-freak it from here to Bangladesh
I riggedy-rippin' flesh plus I get fresh like this
Swish, swiggedy-swooshed kid, you'll get it done
Swooshed for fun, I riggedy-rhyme like no one
I biggedy-bum riggedy-rush chiggedy-chumps, I'm savage
I shake 'em up and down like the Down Jones Average
I'm cocky, like Rocky, I biggedy-bangs the best
So tiggedy-tell your friend, chump, 'cause here comes Das EFX
