I know
No one had ever dreamed that
We were this strong and we'd achieve this
So long the doubt and all believed it
And now
It's come for all to see yeah
We've worked so hard
Pushed every day now
See you can hear us say

Stand up, stand up we were right
You know we can't be more justified and they can't deny it
Stand up, stand up we were right
We've come too far just to fade away and they can't deny it
