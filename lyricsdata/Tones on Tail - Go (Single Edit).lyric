Living it up, it's a big kick
It's good for you
Watch the big freeze slip
Crack the jackpot, get out of control

If you put yourself down
You'll never win, get out of that hole
Keep your mind open, your head up
You'll never ever get old

Ya ya ya ya ya ya yayaya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya yayaya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya yayaya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya yayaya

Go!
