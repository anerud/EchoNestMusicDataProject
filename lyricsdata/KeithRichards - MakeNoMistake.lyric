Make no mistake about it 
Things ain't what they seem 
I'm gonna scream and shout it 
This is just a dream 

A simple conversation 
Every now and then 
A touchy situation 
Fascinates a man 

What shall I do, if I should see you 
And have to pretend that we have never met 

Its not a cheap sensation 
When you touch me with your hand 
A little complication 
...
