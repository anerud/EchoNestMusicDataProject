Buddy I went down to Scarlet Town
Never been there before
You slept on a feather bed
I slept on the floor

I don't mind a little town
Or drinking my coffee cold
But the things I seen in Scarlet Town
Did mortify my soul

Look at that deep well
Look at that dark ray
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today

I spent some time in New Orleans
