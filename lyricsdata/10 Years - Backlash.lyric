Dear God
Will no one get out of here alive
"Lost in your head"
Is new medicine
Floating in the sky

Every clouds come crashing down
Harder every time
Seems to scare me
Loaded fantasies
Flooding out your mind

Fear God for now you've gone
And lost your sight of land
Drunk with power
Your final hour is
Running out of sand

[Chorus:]
