Seven sins of wantonness and
everything that's good is gone
Sell it for the glory from the peers
Silicone priestess scratch the back and
twists the knife to bone
Kick against the pricks and scrape the shins
I'm the enemy in the enemies now

Chorus:
Swallowed the pill
And drank to the fill
All these things I carry now
In this bittersweet, in this bittersweet now
...
