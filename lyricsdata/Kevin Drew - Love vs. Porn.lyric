Well, I woke up and my mouth was a little dry
So I grabbed the moisturizer and tried not to cry
Spoke to my hand and then started to dream

You came into my bed and I tied you up

While people were watching how you and me breathed

And I got lost in the warm
And I got lost in the hole
And I got lost in the arms
The softness I'd stolen was never round to be loved
