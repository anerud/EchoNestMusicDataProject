Dear mother, I love you
I'm sorry, I wasn't good enough
Dear Father, forgive me
Cause in your eyes, I just never added up
In my heart I know I failed you, but you left me here alone

If I could hold back the rain, would you numb the pain?
Cause I remember everything.
If I could help you forget, would you take my regrets?
Cause I remember everything.

But dear brother, just don't hate me
