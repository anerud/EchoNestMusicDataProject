I will climb the highest peak
Swim the deepest sea
I will cross the desert land
I would do anything for your love, yeah
{Unconditional love}

Oh... oh... oh...
I need unconditional love

Baby, once is not enough (No)
I can't live without your love (Oh, yeah)
Pray to the the heavens up above
(Conditional) Conditional love

Some people say that I'm just an old fashioned guy
But I believe in love and all that it means
I can never say no to anything that you ask
And I really hope that you would do the same for me, yeah, yeah, yeah
How far will you go

It's about trust and honesty
And that's the way it's supposed to be
Unconditional love (How far will you go, girl)
It's about time (Time) and sacrifice (Sacrifice)
We pay the price (Do or die), it's do or die
Unconditional love (Unconditional love)

I don't know what to do, girl, I'm head over heels in love with you
And I need to know what it means to you, oh... oh...
