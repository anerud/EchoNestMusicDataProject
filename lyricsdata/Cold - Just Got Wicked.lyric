I can taste your innocence
Young and sweet like mother made you
Everything froze into ice
These motherfuckers just got wicked

I can't explain this little man
Taken over
Can't explain the way that I feel
I can't explain this little man
Taken over
Can't explain the way that I feel

Everyone got twisted up
Everyone got behind my back and broke it
Cause it's my world
Everyone got twisted up
All your friends got behind my back
