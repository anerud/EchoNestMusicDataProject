Let's go back
Back to the beginning
Back to when the earth, the sun, the stars all aligned

'Cause perfect, didn't feel so perfect
Trying to fit a square into a circle
Was no life
I defy

Let the rain fall down
And wake my dreams
Let it wash away
My sanity
'Cause I wanna feel the thunder
I wanna scream
Let the rain fall down
I'm coming clean
I'm coming clean, oh

I'm shedding
Shedding every color
...
