talk:
i just wanna ask a question
where would i be
if i
didn't know you
who
would i be
baby
if i didn't know you

hook:
who would i be
if i didn't know you
where would i be
if i didn't know you
ad lib: where would i be
what would i be
if i didn't know you
ad lib: what would i be, what would i do
who would i be
if i didn't know you
ad lib: if i didn't know you, if i didn't know you baby baby

verse 1:
you don't recognize it
but i tell you no lie
that you're the reason why
my life is turned right
everyday i'm thankful
at times i don't show you
my world would be incomplete
if i didn't know you

hook:
who would i be
if i didn't know you
ad lib: if i didn't know you
where would i be
if i didn't know you
ad lib: where would i be
what would i be
...
