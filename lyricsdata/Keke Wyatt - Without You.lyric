I was a fool for taking it out on you
There's nothing I wouldnt do to make it up to you
One conversation baby thats all I ask
We can work this thing out it really aint all that bad
See I was wrong for what I did all those nasty things I said
I was trying to pay you back for making me so mad
So if my soul my heart I beat
Will you help me on my feet
And I promise you i'll never fall again

[Chorus]
I dont wanna live without you
I dont wanna be without you
I got nothing to give without you
Cause I dont wanna breathe without you
I dont wanna love without you
I think Im giving up without you
I know I cant go another day... without you

[Verse 2]
I stay locked in my room I dont go out no more
