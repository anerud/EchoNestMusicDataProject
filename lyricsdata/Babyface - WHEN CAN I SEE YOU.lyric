When can my heart beat again?
When does the pain ever end?
When do the tears stop from running over
When does, "You'll get over it" begin?

I hear what you're saying
But I swear that it's not making sense
So when can I see you

When can I see you again?
When can my heart beat again?
When can I see you again?
When can I breathe once again?
And when can I see you?
