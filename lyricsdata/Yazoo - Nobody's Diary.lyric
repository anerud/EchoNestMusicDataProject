If I wait for just a second more
I know, I'll forget what I came here for
My head was so full of things to say
But as I open my lips all my words slip away

And anyway I can't believe you want to turn the page
And move your life onto another stage
You can change the chapter, you can change the book
But the story remains the same if you'd take a look

For the times we've had I don't want to be
A page in your diary, babe
