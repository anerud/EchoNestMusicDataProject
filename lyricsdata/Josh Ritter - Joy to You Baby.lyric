i go to the parties
throw my hands in the air
i drink what they pour me
the cups of who cares
go up in the night sky
up in the clouds
fly over the houses
im looking down

joy to the city
joy to the streets
and joy to you baby, wherever you sleep
tonight, tonight, tonight
tonight, tonight, tonight

theres no ghosts in the graveyard
thats not where they live
they float inbetween us
...
