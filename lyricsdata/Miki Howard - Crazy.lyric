Verse 1:
Seek and you shall find
Some times what's in front of your face
You can leave behind
Searching for love that's true
I didn't know it was you
All the time

Pre Chorus:
All the moments we once shared
A friend that's always there

And I knew it was true
Never thought I'd feel this way
All the things we didn't say
When I was
