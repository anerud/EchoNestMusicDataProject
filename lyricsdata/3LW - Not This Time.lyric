Not this time, Not this time
Not this time, Not this time
Not this time, Not this time
Not this time, Not this time

You told me that my love was all good for you
But when I'm not around there's always someone new

With all my trust
And every little kiss
I can't believe you played me out
Like this
All my friends told me
I was not your only
Guess my heart was wrong again

How could I be with someone like you
After all of the things that you put me through
And how could you lie looking straight in my eye
Sorry baby not this time

Not this time, Not this time
Not this time, Not this time
...
