There's a light
A certain kind of light
That never shone on me
I want my life to be
Lived with you
Lived with you

There's a way ev'rybody says
To do each and ev'ry little thing
But what does it bring
If I ain't got you, ain't got faith, baby?

You don't know what it's like
Baby you don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

In my brain
I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
