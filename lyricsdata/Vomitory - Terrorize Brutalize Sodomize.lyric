Blackened mind
Obscurity concealed
Compulsive urge to slay
Upon command from powers deep within

Staring into the eyes of death
Totally paralysed
Hyperventilating, grasping for air
Anticipated pain already so real
A fear beyond all fears

Morning star, cock and hate? my weapons of choice
Fueled by rage, hatred and insanity
...
