Go son

If you get up but they strap you arounds
Then just remember that I will always be there
When I say to you, "Daddy loves you, understands"
I'm out in the real world again I'm tryin'

Raise your guard again
They don't give a damn
Raise your guard again
They don't give a damn
Raise your guard again
They don't give a damn
Raise your guard again
They don't give a damn
(Give a damn)
(They don't give a damn)
(Go son)
