People say I'm cool
Ya, I'm a cool chick, baby
Every day I thank God
That I'm such a cool chick, baby

When I'm on the phone, I thank God
My voice sounds smooth and clear without a trace of tear
When I'm at work, I thank God
I still have that smile Ma used to say lit her day

But something inside me
Something inside me died that day
