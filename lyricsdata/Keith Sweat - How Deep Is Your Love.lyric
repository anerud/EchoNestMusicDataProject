Is your love
How deep is your love
Is your love
How deep is your love
How, oh, how
How deep is your love
Oh, how’s your love

Been all day thinkin’, all night wonderin’
Why love has to change
You kiss me, but it’s not real
Tell me what happened

Are we living a lie, baby
Is that magic gone
Ooh, do you feel the same way you used to, girl
Ooh, tell me is it wrong for us to love like this

How deep is your love 
(How deep is your love)
