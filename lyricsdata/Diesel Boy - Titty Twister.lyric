Eat a bag of shit you suck
I can't believe the luck you have
It's not bestowed on me
And my pants are falling down

I would have another drink
Except it might be poisoned
By my mind
And my pants are falling down

I don't know what you've been drinking
But pour another one for me

My pants are falling down
...
