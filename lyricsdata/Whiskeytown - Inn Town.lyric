Parking lot, movie screen
I can't feel anything
Cigarettes, beat up TV
I can't feel anything

Now that I, I'm inn town
I feel fine, fine for now

Hang around with the people
That I use to be
Hang around on a corner
Waiting to go, have a seat

Now that I, I'm inn town
I feel fine, fine for now

50 cents or a dollar three
I don't owe you anything
Spent a life on a heart that would
Rather not feel anything
...
