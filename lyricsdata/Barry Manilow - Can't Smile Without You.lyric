You know I can't smile without you
I can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't sing
I'm finding it hard to do anything

You see I feel sad when you're sad
I feel glad when you're glad
If you only knew what I'm going through
I just can't smile without you

You came along just like a song
And brighten my day
Who would have believed that you were part of a dream
