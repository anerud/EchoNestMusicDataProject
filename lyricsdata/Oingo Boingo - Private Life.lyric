This is my private life
I have no friends to fear
I've got no problems no cross to bear
If you can find me
come and get me out of here

This is my private place, Everythig is neatand clean,
The skeletons are hidden in the closet,
This is my private place, come & get me out of here

CHORUS
This is my private life
This is my private life
This is my private life . . .

These are my private things
There they are against the wall
...
