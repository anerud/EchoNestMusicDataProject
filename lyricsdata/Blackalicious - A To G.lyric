--We're going to learn to hear words with vowel "A" sound... Listen with care

(Gift of Gab)
I be the analog arsonist, aimin at your arteries
All-seeing abstract, analyze everything

I be the big, bad body rockin Bombay to boulevard bully BACK
Better bring a bomb to the battlefield
Bloody black beats bringing bottoms that boom
Basically build barriers bewilder buffoons

--Listen now to words that begin with letter "C"

Crazy character, constantly creating concontions
Catalyst, a cannabalistic rhymes conqueror
Correctly connecting, craniums crumble down
