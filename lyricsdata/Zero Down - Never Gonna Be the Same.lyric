How much do you pay for product what do you pay for hype.
How long will that purchase matter when that "push" falls from your sight.
If they sugar coat the poison it'll kill you quite the same.
Tune us in as consumers and anesthetize our brains.
We're too dumb to figure out that we all play the game and we're to blame.
Do we know what's fact or fiction do you really trust the news.
