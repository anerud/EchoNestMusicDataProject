The more I talk, the less I say
When the words get in the way
Loneliness is so hard
Loneliness is so hard
Ordinary, I confess
Living under house arrest
Maybe I belong here
Maybe I belong

Suddenly there's beauty in
The way my heart is caving in
And every scar reminds me how
I can't deny

These are the days that last forever
A time in my life I won't surrender
For better or worse, these are the days
In my life I've loved no other
We all have pain, we all have suffered
...
