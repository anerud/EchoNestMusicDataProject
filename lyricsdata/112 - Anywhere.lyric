Here we are all alone
You and me,
Privacy
And we can do anything
Your fantasy
I wanna make your dreams come true
Can you hear?
She's calling me
Between your legs Loud and clear
I wanna talk back to her
Make love to her
I wanna hear you scream my name

We can make love in the bedroom
floating on top of my waterbed
I'm kissing you
Running my fingers through your hair
...
