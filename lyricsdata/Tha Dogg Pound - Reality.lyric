What is reality?
Motherfuckers out here don't know shit
They ain't tryin to know shit
Just a dumb motherfucker out here tryin to represent
Get my motherfuckin paper
You don't think so? Well then fuck you hoe
Cause I'm ridin on trucks, banked all that type of shit
Gotta get paid motherfucker

(Kurupt)
Fuck dreamin the same dreams, bein down for the same team
When it seems to be reality is just a dream
Eye to eye, the colors that I wear is do or die
When I walk down the street, will I meet evil in disguise
So, I tote a fo'-fo' with hollow tips
While my mind tellin me 'should I not', or 'should I peel it?'
What I represent God only knows what lies for myself
Jealousy and hatred niggaz is out for my wealth
Will I perish? Later selfish for the rest of my life
Cause those who live wrong is bound to live a short life
Will money be the root of my destruction?
Without the money I can't even seem to function

(Dat Nigga Daz)
Now there's, nowhere, for me, to turn
There's nowhere for me to hide from reality
As complex as the situation gets
I remain I maintain, ain't that much strain
To make me twist myself like Kurt Cobain
Ahh shit, I don't believe this
