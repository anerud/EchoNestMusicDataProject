[chorus]
Sometimes it's gonna be days like this
sometimes it's gonna be rain like this
sometimes you're gonna feel pain like this
sometimes you gotta work hard for it

because when u feeling low
and u cant get no lower
thats when u know your close
sometimes u gotta work hard for it

woke up in the morning
it's another cloudy day
but that never mattered too much to me
cause its still a new beginning
and I know I got it in me
had my share of ups and downs
but now I know I can do anything

some people think im aggressive
cause I know what I want
but that never mattered too much to me
