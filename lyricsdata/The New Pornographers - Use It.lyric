the cat calls through the night
and two chicks in the parking lot
crack wise on the price of fame
they stood to gain
the phonebook's been ripped off
and two shapes in the dark
across the way know the price of flight
its weight and size
if you've got something 
that sheds some light
use it tonight, tonight
heads down thumbs up
two sips from the cup of human kindness
and im shit faced, just laid to waste
...
