Hey, what's happened to our lives?
When did you and me forget how to have a good time?
You and I gotta get back to the life
That we forgot 'cause we got too much on our minds

Hey, we got to make some time
For the stuff that you can't buy
And get a life
'Cause you know all that serious stuff ain't no fun

Who says you can't be happy all the time?
I know but I'm still gonna try
