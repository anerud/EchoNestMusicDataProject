Ooh, somethin's got a hold on me now
It's a feelin', burnin' like a lover on fire
Hold me tight, baby
Don't leave me by myself tonight
'Cause I don't think I can make it through the night

I think I'm in love
And my life's lookin' up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough (no, no, no)
I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love
