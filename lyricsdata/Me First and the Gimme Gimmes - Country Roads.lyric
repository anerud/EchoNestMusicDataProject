Almost heaven, 
West Virginia 
Blue Ridge Mountains, 
Shenandoah River 
Life is old there, older than the trees 
Younger than the mountains,
 Growing like a breeze 

Country roads, 
Take me home 
To the place 
Where I belong 
West Virginia,
 Mountain momma 
Take me home, 
Country roads 

All my memories 
Gathered 'round her 
...
