Hit me on the street while waiting to do nothing
Where within the space can anything feel certain?
Look into the future make out the word speak
Send in the spies to watch them

Creepy are the people unable to do something
Sitting on an armchair fenced in their creation
Look up to be there anywhere is somewhere
Itchy past scratch the itch

(In the streets)
Hit me in the streets
(Hit me! Hit me!)
(In the streets)
Hit me in the streets
(Hit me! Hit me!)

Feel about a nation
So precious is the freedom
Carousel the brass ring
Reach into a black mass
So it's corroded
So it's polluted
We all want some of it
