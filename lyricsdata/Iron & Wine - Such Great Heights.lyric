I am thinking it's a sign
That the freckles in our eyes are mirror images
And when we kiss they're perfectly aligned

And I have to speculate
That God himself did make us into corresponding shapes
Like puzzle pieces from the clay

And true, it may seem like a stretch
But it's thoughts like this that catch my troubled head when you're away
When I am missing you to death
