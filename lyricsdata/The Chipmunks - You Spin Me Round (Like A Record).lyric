Yeah I, I got to know your name
Well and I, could trace your private number baby
All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your lovin' arms
I want some

Well I... I set my sights on you
(And no one else will do)
And I, I've got to have my way now, baby
(And no one else will do)
And I, I've got to have my way now, baby
All I know is that to me
You look like you're havin' fun
...
