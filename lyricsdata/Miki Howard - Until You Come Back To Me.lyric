Oh…ho…oh…oh…
Oh…ooh…

So you don’t wanna talk to me
Just don’t even call me anymore

Though you don’t call me anymore
I sit and wait in vain
I guess I’ll rap on your door
Tap on your window pane

I wanna tell you, baby
The changes I’ve been goin’ through
Missin’ you, missin’ you
That’s what I’m gonna do

Why did you have to decide
You had have to set me free, baby
I guess I’ll swallow my pride
