CHALI
Seldom traveled by the multitude
The devil's gavel has a couple fooled
My culture's screwed
Cuz this word is misconstrued
Small countries exempt from food
Cuz leaders have different views
You choose

AKIL
What mean the world to me is being free
Live and let live and just let it be
(Let it be)
Love peace and harmony
One universal family
One god, one aim, & one destiny

MARC 7
O yea?
Imagine life without a choice at all
Given a vote without a voice at all
These be the problems that we face
I'm talkin' poverty and race
But no matter what the case we gotta

CHORUS
Hold on to this feeling
