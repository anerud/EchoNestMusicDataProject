Once again you've made your point
But it never really makes a difference
The only problem is that it's
Lying on the floor

So you want to pick it up
It's always been in your court
Just like they've always said
On the floor it will remain

Push your luck so hold your cards up high
A sense of time, but no sense of danger
If only possible to bluff your own way out.
