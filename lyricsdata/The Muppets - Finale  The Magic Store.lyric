It starts when we're kids, a show-off in school
Makin' faces at friends, you're a clown and a fool

Doin' prat-falls and bird-calls and bad imitations
Ignoring your homework, now that's dedication
You work to the mirror, you're getting standing ovations

You're burning with hope, you're building up steam
What was once juvenilish, is grown-up and stylish
You're close to your dream
