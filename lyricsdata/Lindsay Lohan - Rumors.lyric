Saturdays stepping into the club
The music makes me want to tell the DJ "turn it up"
I feel the energy all around
And my body can't stop moving to the sound

But I can tell that you're watching me
And you're probably gonna write what you didn't see
Well I just need a little space to breathe
Can you please respect my privacy?

Why can't you just let me do,
The things I wanna do,
I just wanna be me,
I don't understand,
Why would you wanna bring me down,
I'm only having fun,
I gonna live my life (like I wanna do)

I'm tired of rumors starting
I'm sick of being followed
I'm tired of people lying,
Saying what they want about me
Why can't they back up off me
Why can't they let me live
I'm gonna do it my way
Take this for just what it is

Here we are back up in the club
