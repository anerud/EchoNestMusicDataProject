I never knew love like this before
Now I'm lonely never more
Since you came into my life
You are my lovelight, this I know
And I'll never let you go
You my all, you're part of me

Once I was lost and now I'm found
Then you turned my world around
When I need you, I call your name

'Cause I never knew love like this before, opened my eyes
