A fool in love
A crazy situation
Her velvet glove
Knocks me down and down and down and down

Her kiss of fire
A loaded invitation
Inside her smile
She takes me down and down and down and down

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Her moves look good
A touch of desperation
From where I stood
She turned my head around, round and round

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

It comes kinda hard
