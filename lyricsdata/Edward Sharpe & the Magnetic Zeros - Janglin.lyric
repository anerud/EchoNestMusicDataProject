Well our mamas they left us
And our daddies took a ride
And we walked out of the castle
And we held our head up high
Well we once were the jesters
In your kingdom by the sea
And now we're out to be the masters
For to set our spirits free – set free

(Chorus)
We want to feel ya!
We don't mean to kill ya!
