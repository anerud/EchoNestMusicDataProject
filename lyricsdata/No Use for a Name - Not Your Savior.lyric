Unlucky seventeen,
Already handed plans for the future
Glamour obsessed, told how to dress,
and shown how to think
And I don't have a job,
but I can show you how to be a slob
So many days, wasted and glazed
Sometimes I laugh aloud as I think about
you asking me "Please can you help?"
Can't help my self
I'm not your savior,
...
