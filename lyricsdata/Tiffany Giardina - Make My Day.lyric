Woke up late
World won't wait
So I make my way downstairs

Mom freaks out
Please don't shout
I still have to dry my hair

I've been up all night
Just thinking you're the one
Who's in my dreams

My heart just keeps on jumping
When I think what we could be

Just go ahead and make my day
You make the world just melt away
When things go wrong and skies are gray
Just make my day, make my day
