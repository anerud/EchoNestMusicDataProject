Talking about stealing the show
No one would know
Talking about stealing the show
When they're all letting go
Take a look at the witch
See the twitch in her eye
Tell me what did she feel
Is this the way of the world
To take the boy and a girl
Show them lying is real
Then I see the edge I look, I fall
When I get deeper and deeper
The more I see the more I fall
No place to hide, I better take the call
I get deeper and deeper
Was is it the smell of the oil
And the sweat and the toil
That makes living unreal
Was it the man in the suit
Or the man with a flute
And tell me what did he steal
Is it beginning to break
