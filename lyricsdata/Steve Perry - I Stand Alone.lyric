I Stand Alone


I know the sound of each rock and stone
I embrace what others fear
You are not to roam in this forgotten place
Just the likes of me are welcome here


Everything breathes
And I know each breath
It's more than enough for this man


Like every tree stands on its own
Reaching for the sky I stand alone
I share my world
With no one else
