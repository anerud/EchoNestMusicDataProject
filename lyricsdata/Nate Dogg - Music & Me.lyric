Hey OG, could you tell how to find some good weed
I need it homie oh, so fast
That last bag was the best weed I've ever had
Bass so deep, I can't even seem to feel my feet

Girls so fine
I can't help it got to make this one mine
I hit em with my, gangsta leans
They can't separate my music from me

Music and me, music and me, music and me
Music, my music and me
...
