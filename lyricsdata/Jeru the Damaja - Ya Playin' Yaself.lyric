"Yo, are you a pimp, a hustler?"
"No I'm not."
"Are you a man, and can you stand alone like a man has to sometimes?"
"Yes I can."
"Are you willing, to go out there and save the lives of our children, even if it means losing your own life?"
"Yes I am."
"I believe you Jeru, you're ready."
*You've no-no-nothing to worry about*

Verse One:
Now, I don't push a Lex
Others had their turn to flex, Jeru is up next
All these so called players up in the rap game
Got brothers on the corner selling cooked cocaine
It used to be LaToya and jim hats
But now it's uzis, macs and g-packs of cracks
Everybody's psycho or some type of goodfellow
But me I keep it real that's all swine like jello
Don't drink Cristal, and I can't stand Mo
Never received currency for moving a kilo
Or an ounce, make em bounce to this fake-pimp free flow
I never knew hustlers confessed in stereo
Or on video get caught you'll know who turned State's
Evidence, murder weapon, confession and fingerprints
Mama always said watch what comes out your mouth
Tight case for the DA from here to down South
Knowledge wisdom understanding like King Solomon's wealth
You're a player but only because you be playin yourself

Chorus:
With all that Big Willie talk, hop, you're playin yaself
With all that big gun talk, bop, you're playin yaself
With all that rah rah rah, you're playin yaself
