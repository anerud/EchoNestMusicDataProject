Please don't chase me anymore
Nearly forgot just what i'm running for
I meant no harm, my gas pedal is to the floor


People watch this on tv
Never thought that this could happen to me
I can't stop now and it still seems like a dream


Never thought I'd hurt someone
Now I see you clutching your gun
You're playing for keeps, there's no place left to run


Chorus:
I had to make a choice I made it
If I had another chance i'd take it
