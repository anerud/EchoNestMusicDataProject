Every time I see your face
I'm leaving with a bitter taste my friend
And every time I hear your voice
You're leaving me with little choice my friend

But there ain't nothing left here for you to say, you shut your mouth
I'm gonna put a bullet into your brain and shut you down
When there ain't nothing left here for you to say, I shut you out
Another side effect of the chemicals I take
