Wake your punk ass up
The MC Eiht's back in the muthaf**king house
Kicking the straight gansta shit for teh 9-1
You know what I'm saying, yea

Growing up in the hood, yea boy, 1984
Was the year my peers didn't know what was in store
A little hard head kid came abade
Time to pay my dues, learn the tricks of the trade
And at home, it's the same ass story
Mom's treat me like she don't even know me
But my younger brother's got much clout
I can't take this shit so I bones the hell out
And roll wit the pack of wicked muthaf**kas
No shorts are taken, we're down black brothers
A little nigga wit no problems at all
F**ked up and killed my first 8-ball
Quick up the stairs so little sucker stop looking
Stagger to the house so I can collect my whooping
But watch out 'cause a little nigga's up to no good
Growin' up in the hood

()
Life ain't nuttin but bitches and money
'Cause in the city you live and let die
Nutting but bitches and money

I got hard times and realize,?(skate)? sometimes I wonder
But it just seems that the hood could took me under
Police sweat my tip and keep harrassing
Trying to lock me up 'cause I keep on blasting
