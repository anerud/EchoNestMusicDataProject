Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby

Oh baby, baby
How was I supposed... to know
That somethin' wasn't right?

Oh baby, baby
I shouldn't have let... you go
And now you're outta sight

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now Oh because

My loneliness... is killin' me
I must confess... I still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign...
hit me baby one more time

Oh baby, baby
...
