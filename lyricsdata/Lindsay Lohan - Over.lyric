I watch the walls around me crumble
But it's not like I won't build them up again
So here's your last chance for redemption
So take it while it lasts 'cause it will end

And my tears are turning into time
I've wasted trying to find a reason for goodbye

I can't live without you
Can't breathe without you
I'm dreaming about you, honestly
Tell me that it's over
'Cause if the world is spinning and I'm still living
It won't be right if we're not in it together
Tell me that it's over

And I'll be the first to go
Don't wanna be the last to know
I won't be the one to chase you
