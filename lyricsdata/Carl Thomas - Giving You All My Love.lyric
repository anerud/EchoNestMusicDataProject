[Intro]
I just wanna hold you in my arms
Oh oh, oh yeah

All alone by the phone
Waiting on you to call on a busy weekend
Tell me have I seen when I stayed around
Around the town waiting on you to tell me what to do
Cuz I'm happy being with you

Touching you, holding you
Is all I really wanna do
Day and night I just can't get enough
I want you more, and really need
For you to just believe in me
And I'll be giving you all of my love
