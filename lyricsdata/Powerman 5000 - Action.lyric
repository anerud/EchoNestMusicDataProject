Ahh... Go!
The sky is falling it's a curious condition
It ain't a fallacy, it ain't superstition
You live your life like you're some kind of actor
But this scenario you cannot manufacture

We're gonna need some action
We're gonna need some action soon
Trapped in a world of ordinary madness
It's all the same, there's nothing new

Com'on, com'on
Com'on, com'on
Com'on, com'on

Where'd you learn how to be so complacent?
