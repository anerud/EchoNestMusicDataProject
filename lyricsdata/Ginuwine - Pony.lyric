I'm just a bachelor
I'm looking for a partner
Someone who knows how to ride
Without even falling off
Gotta be compatible
Takes me to my limits
Girl when I freak you out
I promise that you won't want to get off

If you're horny let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come and jump on it
If you're horny let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come and jump on it

Sitting here flossing
Peepin' your steelo
Just once if I have the chance
The things I would do to you
You and your body
...
