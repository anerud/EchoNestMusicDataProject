I've met some people along the way
Some of them split some of them stay
Some of them walk, some walk on by
I've got a few friends I'll love till I die
From all of these people I try to learn
Some of them shine, some of them burn
Some of them rise, some of them fall
For good or bad I've known them all

We live our life in our own way
Never really listened to what they say
The kind of faith that doesn't fade away
We are the true believers

Ahhhhh
Ahhhhhhh
