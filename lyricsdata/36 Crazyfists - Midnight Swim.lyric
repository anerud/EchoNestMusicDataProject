The sun will set tonight
The sun will set

It's a midnight swim
Where it is late and the air is all clear
And I remember that evenin', you on the floor
I was attached to the ceiling

Look behind the glass in your mouth
These words I am due for

The sun will set tonight
Under the lonely dreamers
(Lonely dreamers)
Only to rise again
So we can start it over
(We'll start it again)

And you were right
...
