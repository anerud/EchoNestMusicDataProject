VERSE 1:
Every time I'm telling secrets
I remember how it used to be
And I realized how much I miss you
And I realize how it feels to be free

Now I see I'm up to no good (no, no, no)
And I wanna start again
Can't remember when I felt good (baby)
No I can't remember when

CHORUS:
No, only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
...
