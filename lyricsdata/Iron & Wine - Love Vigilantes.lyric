Oh, I've just come from the land of the sun
From a war that must be won in the name of truth
With our soldiers so brave, your freedom we will save
With our rifles and grenades and some help from God

I want to see my family
My wife and child waiting for me
I've got to go home
I've been so alone, you see

You just can't believe the joy I did receive
...
