She‘ll lie and steal and cheat, and beg you from her knees.
Make you thinks she means it this time
She‘ll tear a hole in you, the one you can‘t replace
But I still love her, I don‘t really care

When we were young, 
Oh Oh, we did enough
When it got cold, 
Ooh Ooh, we bundled up
I cant be told, 
Ah Ah It cant be done

It‘s better to feel pain, than nothing at all
The oppisite of love‘s indifference
