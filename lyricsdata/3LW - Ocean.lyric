He who stands by me
Through the stormy weather
Through good times and bad
Always there for me
Takes me to the water
And quenches my thirst
My sweet inspiration
I wanna say

Your love is an ocean
Wide as the skies
A comfort to me
Time after time
Your precious love
Fills up my cup
Touches my soul

He who knows me better
Than no man on earth
Guides me to the mountain
Witness my rebirth
Makes me feel so worthy
To belong to him
I treasure my commitment
And it's because of...
