No, don't just walk away
Pretending everything's okay
And you don't care about me

And I know it's just no use
When all your lies become your truths
And I don't care, yeah, yeah, yeah

Could you look me in the eye
And tell me that you're happy now, oh
Would you tell it to my face?
Or have I been erased?
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

You took all there was to take
And left me with an empty plate
And you don't care about it, yeah
...
