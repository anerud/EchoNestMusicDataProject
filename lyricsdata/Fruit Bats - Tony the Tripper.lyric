Tony the tripper and me
and the dude who thought he was my hero
and the mayor of Nowheresville
and the girl with the wandering eye came a wandering by

We was all under the date palm tree
they left the rolling of one up to me
knowing the world might end tomorrow anyway

Back at the burnout chalet
with some brokedown punks and some zeroes
...
