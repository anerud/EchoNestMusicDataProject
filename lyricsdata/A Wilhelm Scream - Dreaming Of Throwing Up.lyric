So I'm looking at this bottle, and this bottle, it speaks to me.
It says get off the f**king train, so I jumped down.
These metaphors are for assholes, and I'm not different.

Roses and poetry; that's all you want to be?
It's not alive, and not dead. It's looking for a reason to be.
Not alive, and not dead.
