With the absence of eye
I can start to bleed again
And the colour of hearts
It seems that you wear right thin

And as it falls from your mouth
It seems like you needed it more
Well I can still ask for more
I could still ask for more

Get the fuck out, stay the fuck out
It makes me sick (I'm all right)
Slit wrist theory, stains us all

Lace me up
Lace me up
I'm still looking for
These angels in the snow

Lace me up
...
