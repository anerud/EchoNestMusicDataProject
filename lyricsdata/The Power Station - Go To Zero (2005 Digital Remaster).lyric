Hey, hey on your marks, get set go to zero
Present and correct go to zero
North, south, east and west go to zero
Nothing is best go to zero

I do this and I do that, and when it's cold, I wear a hat,
It's mostly cold
It pays to advertise thay say, I'll keep my hat on anyway
Or so I'm told

When you're on patrol go to zero
By remote control go to zero
