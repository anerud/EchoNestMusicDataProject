Come forth for the cattle call
Confront the evil river you can't control
Wicked ways and venomous eyes
Just human nature in disguise
Lost in this world
Out on the edge
With death by our sides

Today I sworn that I wouldn't mourn you
Clouds over California
If that's the way it's gonna be
Then I'll fucking go it alone

I'm a saint in sinners eyes
...
