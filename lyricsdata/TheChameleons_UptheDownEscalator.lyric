I'm gazing at faces
Staring blankly at me
I suppose it's just a sign of the times
They tell me tomorrow will never arrive
But I've seen it end a million times

I lost my direction while dodging the flak
Oh give me a hint or something
Now they can erase us
At the flick of a switch
How long will they wait
No!
