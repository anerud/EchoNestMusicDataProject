Can't sleep at night, I toss and turn
Listenin' for the telephone
But when I get your call, I'm all choked up
Can't believe you called my home

And as a matter of fact, it blows my mind
You would even talk to me
Because a girl like you is like a dream come true
A real life fantasy

Don't matter what your friends try to tell you
We will even fall in love
And we will be together in any kind of weather
Just like that, just like that

Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together
Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together

Can't think too straight, I'm all confused
You must've put a thing on me
Because there are no words that can explain
I'm livin' in ecstasy

And you can rest easy, I've got your back
...
