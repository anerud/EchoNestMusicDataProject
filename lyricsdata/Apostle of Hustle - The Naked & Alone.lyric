I can't forget your face
Yours was like a mansion
Long hallways in your eyes
With portraits of your masters
Now instead of leaning back
Ease back on it

Send those fuckers packing

Forget the thing you used to trust
Naked is as naked does

You came for us - the world of the startled
It was a lesson - is amarine
You came for us - statement appears to do with us
