Dark bodies floating in darkness
No sign of light ever given
Imprisoned in a world without a memory
Unconscious or am I conscious?
Cut from the heart I am part of
Sometimes I feel as though I'm frozen in Heaven

And I saw my own face in the dark and loneliness
And I saw my own face like a spark frozen in Heaven

In dreams I see myself flying
Closer to the sun and I'm climbing
Tried to touch the sun
But the brightness burned my eyes
...
