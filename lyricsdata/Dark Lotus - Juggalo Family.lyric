(J talking)
"And they wanted to know if I would trade 10 Juggalos
for a hundred mainstream fans?" And I said "I wouldn't trade
10 Juggalos for a hundred thousand mainstream fans,
10 Juggalos is priceless."

(Blaze Ya Dead Homie)
I gots love for my homies, members of the Lotus
United we stand, squashing all deadly forces
Been to Hell, could'a spent eternity there
All the bad shit I done, I should still be there
Juggalos can ya feel me? world-wide! (world-wide)
Runnin' wit' a hatchet straight out the Lotus Pod
Always got your back, 'til the end, screaming Juggalos
Dark Lotus, Psychopathic thats the way it go

(Monoxide Child)
So many people in the matrix die alone, hey
Not me, my soul belongs to Juggalos, they
Keep me going when I'm, down and out
I pick the phone up, drop'em a line, and hear 'em shout
Sayin' Twiztid is the shit and I'm down with the clown
Dark Lotus for life, until I'm dead in the ground
I give a dap to all my homies and killas who get it started
All my Juggalos always represent for the departed

(Chorus: repeat 2X)
Mass murder makes me happy!
Dead bodies make me happy!
Until eternity!
