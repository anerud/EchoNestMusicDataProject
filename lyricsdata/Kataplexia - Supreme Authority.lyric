Unconsciously developing a vast fury
For being constantly refused
Denied into the superficial society

Traumatizing and repressed hateness
Deliberated through all the years of corruption
Engendering new devastating brains

Under treating the overincredulous masses
Living a continuously world of mediocrity
Believing in a false testimony of promises
Where the laws are ruled by a supreme authority

Rivalry between the madness and purity
