Let's go

Everybody needs to start their own fire
Everybody needs a riot of their own
Everybody needs to be something that they are not
Everybody needs to go it alone

Because living so free is a tragedy
When you can't be what you want to be
Living so free is a tragedy
When you can't see what you need to see
Okay!

In all the time spent hanging on to anything
In all the time spent knowing that they're wrong
