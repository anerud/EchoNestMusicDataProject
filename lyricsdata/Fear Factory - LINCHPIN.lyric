Can't take me apart
Can't take me apart

See the light
A new day has arrived for us
Genesis of our evolution
A linchpin holds within
A means to an end
Can't you see that we are one?

Can't take me apart
Can't take me apart
Can't take me apart
Can't take me apart
No you can't

We see no end to the dream
We will never see the end
We will never be the end
All my life I've felt discarded
 (Aaa)
Never feeling a part of it
 (Aaa)
