You got a smile so bright
You know you could've been a candle
I'm holding you so tight
You know you could've been a handle

The way you sweep me off my feet
You know you could've been a broom
The way you smell so sweet
You know you could've been perfume

(CHORUS)
Well, you could've been anything
That you wanted to and I can tell
The way you do the things you do
(The way you do the things you do)
The way you do the things you do
