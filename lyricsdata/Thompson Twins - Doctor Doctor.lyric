I saw you there
Just standing there
And I thought I was only dreaming, yeah

I kissed you then
Then once again
You said you would come and dance with me

Dance with me
Across the sea
And we can feel the motion of a thousand dreams

Doctor! Doctor!
Can't you see I'm burning, burning
Oh Doctor! Doctor!
Is this love I'm feeling?

Ships at night
