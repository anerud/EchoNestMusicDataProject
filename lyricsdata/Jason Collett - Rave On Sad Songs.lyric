Last night I dreamt I died as I slept on the floor
Head between the speakers with tears fallin' stereo
It's cold he said as he climbed out of bed, will this winter ever go
He took your hands & warmed them in my own so

Rave on you sad songs, sad songs rave on
I'm just feelin the temperature happiness is for amateurs

Up in the afternoon grey until the evenings fade to black we crashed into the morn
