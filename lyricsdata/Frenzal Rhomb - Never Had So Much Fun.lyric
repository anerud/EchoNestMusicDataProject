I smoked a pack of cigarettes before midday
I coughed up a lung around one
I can't see a thing through my eyes that sting
I can't remember having so much fun

Well I've never had so much fun
No I've never had so much fun
I can't remember when I've ever had so much fun

Can't drink the water in Sydney
Can't eat the food in Japan
And you can't breath the air in Los Angeles
But a million people think they can
...
