I'm taking my freedom, pulling it off the shelf
Putting it on my chain, wearing it around my neck
I'm taking my freedom, putting it in my car
Wherever I choose to go it will take me far

I'm living my life like its golden
livin' my life like its golden
livin' my life like its golden
livin' my life like its golden
livin' my life like its golden
golden
livin' my life like its golden
livin' my life like its golden
livin' my life like its golden
livin' my life like its golden
livin' my life like its golden
golden

I'm taking my own freedom, putting it in my song
singing loud and strong, groovin all day long
