And take a little walk when the worst is to come
When I saw you looking like I never thought
And say you're at a loss or forgot that words can do more than harm

And the town is gonna talk, where as people do not
See things through to the very minimal
But what's it gonna cost to be gone?
If we see you like I hoped we never would
