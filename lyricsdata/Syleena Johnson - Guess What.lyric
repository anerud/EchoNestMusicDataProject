Listen, baby

I don't see no rings on these fingers
So I'm not gonna deal with your drama
Long as you're with me, you got to show respect
Get out and get a job and bring home a check

See, I will love you till the day I die
But never love you enough that I'mma live a lie
So three snaps up, three snaps down
Wanna be treated like a king you better wear the crown

Wanna play the boss, guess what
You got to pay the cost, sho' 'nuff
You wanna wear the pants, guess what
You got to be a man, sho' 'nuff

Hangin' out with your friends, guess what
Don't watch what time you come in, sho' 'nuff
Don't wanna pay the bills, guess what
I know somebody who will, sho' 'nuff, listen

Now we've been shackin' up since '93
I ain't gettin' no younger, I need some guarantee
The best years of my life is what I've given you
Argue, fuss and fight, seems that's all you do

And us goin' to church always in your plans
But come Sunday mornin' you play sick in bed
