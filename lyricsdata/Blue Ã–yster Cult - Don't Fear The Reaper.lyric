All our times have come
Here but now they’re gone
Seasons don’t fear the reaper
Nor do the wind the sun or the rain
(we can be like they are)
Come on baby (don’t fear the reaper)
Baby take my hand (don’t fear the reaper)
We’ll be able to fly (don’t fear the reaper)
Baby I’m your man
La-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la

Valentine is done
Here but now they’re gone
...
