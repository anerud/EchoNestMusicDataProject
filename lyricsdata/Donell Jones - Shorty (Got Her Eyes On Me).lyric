Ooh, ooh...
Ooh, ooh...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
Whoa, whoa...
Whoa, whoa... Yeah...
Listen baby

[Verse 1]
Up in the place I see you getting down
Can't help but look at you
Gotta crowd around you
Now you're the baddest thing I've seen tonight
So come on girl let's put it in flight
I got the V-1-2, 6-4-0
Sitting outside of the door
So bring it on, by the way
Your body's plays for
I like the little thing around your navel
