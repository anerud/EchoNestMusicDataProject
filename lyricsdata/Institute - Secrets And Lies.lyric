Transformation
We become someone else
Dislocation
As we get so far from ourselves
My condition's getting worse
I can't do without
Addiction is the lust
That won't let you out

All your secrets and your lies
Walk fast out of burning buildings
Kill youth with easy listening
You gotta keep terror at a healthy distance
It's fine
From time to time
