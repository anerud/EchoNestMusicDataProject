You got me thinking
(You, you)
Of you for you
Got me telling my mama
(You)
And my friends all about you

In my daydreams are you
Touching, holding, kissing
(You, you)
As I'm sweaty with, came right on time
(You, you)
Hey you, every word in this song

Girl, every word in this song's
Gonna be about you
Girl, every word in this song's
Gonna be about you

Girl, every word in this song's
Gonna be about you
Girl, every word in this song's
Gonna be about you

You don't stress me at times you test me
(You)
But I pass for
(You)
So I promise I'm not leaving
Only a fool would leave or try to deceive

I give me word to I would die for
(You)
