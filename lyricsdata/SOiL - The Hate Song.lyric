I'm a match, you're dynamite
An open flame to your gasoline
My peddled flower, my finest hour
You're the razor blade that I need
The heart's wish within my dreams
A nightmare the likes I've never seen

You and I, me and you
My life
Me and you, you and I
I wonder why

You are so beautiful
So I wrote you this lovely little hate song
Our love is so true
I wrote this love song to let you know I hate you
I hate you

Forever ain't long enough
