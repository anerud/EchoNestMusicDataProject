Naturally, you and me, we have a bit of jealousy
I might ask, "Why she call?", you might ask, "Who is he?"
But I can never think of letting go
Ain't no other man that could have me

No way, no how, no circumstance
If you thought about it, no, think again
Baby, slow your role, you ain't leaving me, no
I ain't letting you go, all I ever think about is you

And I guess I never really ever loved no one
All I ever think about is you
From the rising of the moon 'til the setting of the sun
It's all around me and I'm feeling so confused

I'm really scared lying here, 'bout to fall
'Cause all I ever think about is
Tryin' to get back, yeah, I wanna get back to you
'Cause all I ever think about is you

Naturally we disagree, I'm mad at you, you mad at me
Then I tell you something sweet just to keep you here with me
