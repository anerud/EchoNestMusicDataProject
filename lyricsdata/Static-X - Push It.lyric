Go!

Corrosive
Tainted by my sin
I'm spilling blood and I can hardly contain it
Corrosive
Hallowing the hand
Stiffened, I eat away
Eat, eat into the surface

Yeah, you push it
Yeah, you push it
Yeah, you push it

You push it
You push it
You push it

Explosive, more violent, more violent
All consuming throbbing straight to the circle
Explosive, move on reaction
...
