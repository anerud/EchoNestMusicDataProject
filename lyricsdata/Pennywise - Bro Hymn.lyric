To all my friends,
Present past and beyond
even though you weren't with us too long
live is the most precious thing that we could lose
While you were here the fun was neverending
Laugh a minute was a new beginning
Canton, Colvin, Nichols, this one's for you!

Ever get that feeling you can't go on
Just remember whose side it is that you're on
You've got friends with you till the end
...
