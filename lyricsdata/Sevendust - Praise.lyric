What did you expect?
Fools often sometimes forget
Who really knows what's the truth
Often dignified

How funny changing the tide
Feels like you already knew

(Praise)
like the devil
(Connect)
You would never
(Sick man)
Running circles
Feels like you already knew

(Praise)
Like the devil
(Connect)
You would never
(Sick man)
Running circles
Feels like you already knew

Save you
I would never
Deny you
Even though your hate for me is strong
