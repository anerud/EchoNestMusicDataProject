If I'm butter, if I'm butter
If I'm butter, then he's a hot knife
He makes my heart a cinemascope
He's showing the dancing bird of paradise

If I'm butter, if I'm butter
If I'm butter, then he's a hot knife
He makes my heart a cinemascope
He's showing the dancing bird of paradise

He excites me
Must be like a genesis of rhythm
I get feisty
Whenever I'm with him

If I'm butter, if I'm butter
If I'm butter, then he's a hot knife
...
