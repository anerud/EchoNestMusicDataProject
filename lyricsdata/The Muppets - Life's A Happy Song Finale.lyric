Everything is great
Everything is grand
We've got the whole wide world in the palm of my hand
Everything is perfect
It's falling into place
I can't seem to wipe this smile off my face
[Life's a happy song]
When there's someone by my side to sing along

Everything is great
We'll live happily ever after
And we'll keep giving the world the third greatest gift
Laughter!
Si, movie's almost over
It's time to say "So Long!"
