Peter said to Paul you know all those words we wrote 
Are just the rules of the game and the rules are the first to go... But now talking to God is Laurel, begging Hardy for a gun 
I got a girl in the war man, I wonder what it is we done 


Paul said to Peter "you got to rock yourself a little harder" 
Pretend the dove from above is a dragon, and your feet are on fire But I got a girl in the war Paul the only thing I know to do 
Is turn up the music and pray that she makes it through 
...
