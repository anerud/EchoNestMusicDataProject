Deep ocean vast sea

Your ocean heart
Clothed in respect
And sweet caress
My uneasy mind
You dip and you swell
Float and you find
And sweet caress
My uneasy mind

Deep ocean vast sea
Deep ocean vast sea - well that's deep

Imagine set of steps easily climbed
The tower of pride
The plastic of mind
Where there lies a table
The table stands
For the power of success
Respect on the sign
Intelligence so cold
A heart like glass
