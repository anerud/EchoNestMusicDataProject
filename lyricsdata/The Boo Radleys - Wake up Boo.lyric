Summer's gone, day's spent with the grass and sun
I don't mind, to pretend I do seems really dumb
I rise as the morning comes, crawling through the blinds
I shouldn't be up at this time, but I can't sleep with you there by my side

Wake up, it's a beautiful morning
The sun shining for your eyes
Wake up, it's so beautiful
For what could be the very last time

Twenty five, don't recall a time I felt this alive
...
