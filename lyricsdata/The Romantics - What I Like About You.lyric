hey, uh huh huh
hey, uh huh huh

what I like about you, you hold me tight
tell me I'm the only one, wanna' come over tonight, yeah

phone whispering in my ear
tell me all the things that I wanna hear, 'cause it's true
[ that's what I like]
that's what I like about you
[that's what I like]

what I like about you, you really know how to dance
when you go up, down, jump around, think about true romance, yeah

phone whispering in my ear
tell me all the things that I wanna hear, 'cause it's true
[that's what I like about you]
