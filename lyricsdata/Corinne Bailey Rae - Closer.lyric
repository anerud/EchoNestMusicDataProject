I don't want to give you up
I don't want to hold you up
I don't want ambiguous
I just know that I've had enough
I want you to travel with me
Let loose and let your mind go free... Show you things that you've never seen
You just got to go with me
Ohhh

(Chorus)
Your love is so good that I want to show you
Don't make me responsible, for something that you can't find
Ohhh
