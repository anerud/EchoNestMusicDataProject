She would sit and listen for hours as I played guitar yo
Sing my songs up on the radio while she was in her car yo
Her interest will grow
She came to my shows
She new every note
Each line that I wrote
And suddenly she was in love
In time I met this little girl was attracted to her ways yo
What took years for some couples to build for us it just took days yo
So as time went on I wrote her more songs
Not knowing those songs will soon come along
Leaving me in pain oh...

Chorus:
Show must go on unfortunately
I'm all alone
Up from my dreams
‘Cause she couldn't hear me over the music
Didn't hear me over the music
...
