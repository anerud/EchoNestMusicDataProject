Baby doll
My baby doll
You're just fine
The way you are
So what's the matter?
Where's the problem?

'Cause they don't know you like I do

Took my heart and made me feel things
I never felt, before
It's changing me
Which direction, so suddenly
Shook me up and it threw me around
Helped me learn to breathe it all in
