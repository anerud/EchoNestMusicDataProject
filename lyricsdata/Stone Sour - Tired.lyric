I'm alive in here
So alive in here
Pulling down a little peace
I'm open wide in here
Slow to rise in here
Saving grace and killing me

You say this only makes me incomplete
I'm canceled out and rendered obsolete
Tell the mad chameleon he's not welcome anymore
I know what I'm looking for...

Somewhere close
Somewhere safe
Somewhere I know (I know)
I'll never live in chains
...
