It's not the red of the dying sun
The morning sheets surprising stain
It's not the red of which we bleed

The red of cabernet sauvignon
A world of ruby all in vain

It's not that red

It's not as golden as Zeus famous shower
It doesn't, not at all, come from above
It's in the open but it doesn't get stolen
...
