Who draws the crowd and plays so loud
baby it's the guitar man
who's gonna steal the show
you know, baby, it's the guitar man
He can make you love
he can make you cry
he will bring you down
then he'll get you high
somethin' keeps him goin'
miles and miles a day
to find another place to play
Night after night who treats you right
baby, it's the guitar man
who's on the radio
you go listen to the guitar man
Then he comes to town
...
