Want some whiskey in your water
Sugar in your tea?
What's these crazy questions
They're askin' me?
This is the craziest party
That there ever could be
Don't turn on the lights
'Cause I don't wanna see

Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
That ain't no way to have fun, no

Open up your window
Let some air into this room
I think I'm almost chokin'
From the smell of stale perfume
...
