What we're gonna do right here is go back
Way back
Back into time

If you take your love away from me
I'll go crazy
I'll go insane

You've got your problems baby and I've got mine
Lets just end it all by putting it together, yeah
When you say you love me It don't mean a thing
If you cared You'd be there Like you used to be, yeah

I'm searching for the words to make you realize
That I really, really want you to stay, Oh yeah
Tears of frustration I hold inside
But if you walk away you'll make this grown man cry

Chorus:
Don't leave
Don't leave me girl
Please stay with me tonight (nah baby, nah baby, nah baby)
