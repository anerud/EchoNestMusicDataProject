You and I have never been good at keeping in touch, all the bridges that we burned ended up costing so much
Both agreed it would be better not to ask questions but it seems to me that you enjoy these awkward memories

Now it's time we finally come to terms with fabricated stories and delirium
I resent you for embarrassing me, you hate me for my shortcomings
From now on we will always be living in separate realities
Ones where we don't exist to each other at all
