I've been waiting on the slide
Suggest I open wide
No incentive to hide
Happy coursing through my veins
Don't even know my name
When I'm up you're coming down
When I'm up you're coming down

Inside of me, some sight to see
Some sight to feel our earthy bed

When we're wrapped in polythene
What's that supposed to mean
Paper flowers bring me luck
...
