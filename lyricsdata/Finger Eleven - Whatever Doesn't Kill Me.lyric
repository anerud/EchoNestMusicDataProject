Don't mistake the silences
There's so much I haven't said
It's not that quiet in my head
But I can't even tell you that

Whatever doesn't kill me
Doesn't make me stronger
But I'm not gonna give up yet
And if these walls should weaken
I'm still strong enough to know
I'm gonna build them up again

There's one more thing left to try
(And it just might work)
...
