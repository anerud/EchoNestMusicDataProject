Well fire it up
Chop one out
Somebody's got to know
That I'm two days in
I got two days left to go
Cause I am Georgia
I am Memphis Tennesee
I am everything
Hollywood wants to be
I am love and I am hate
I'm your late night drunk debate
But you'll never put
Your finger on me

Have you ever seen the sun
Over the Rocky Mountains shining
Or touched the sands
Of a Southern Florida beach
Have you seen a grown man cry
Or a child thats slowly dying
...
