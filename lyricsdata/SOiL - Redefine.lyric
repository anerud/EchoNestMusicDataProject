First Sight
Turns me round again
Brings me face to face with my sin
I've got it, Always had it
A reason to look within now
Take flight
To your son again
Burns the sin
Straight from my hands
I've got it, Always had it
A reason to live within now.

Every time I fall, You catch me
And every time I lose control
You help me, you save me
And every time I lose myself
You find me, redefine me
