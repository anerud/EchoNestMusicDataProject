I got a woman who's wild as Rome
She likes bein' naked and gazed upon
She crosses a bridge, she sets in on fire
She lands like a bird on a telephone wire

I'm gonna hollar and I'm gonna scream
I'm gonna get me some mescaline
And then I'm gonna rhyme that with gasoline
It's a drunken poet's dream

There's some money on the table and a pistol on the floor
A few paperback books by Louis L'Amour
