Day after day, time pass away

And I just can't get you off my mind

Nobody knows

I hide it inside

I keep on searching but I cant find

The courage to show to letting you know

I've never felt so much love before

And once again
I'm thinking about
Taking the easy way out

But if I let you go,
I will never know
What my life would be holding you close to me
Will I ever see you smiling back at me?
How will I know if I let you go?
