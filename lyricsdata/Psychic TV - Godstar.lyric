This is a story, a very special story.
It's about Brian Jones, one of the Rolling Stones.

Where were you when the stars went out?
Where were you when they started to shout?
I saw you alone by the pool,
and all your friends called you a fool.
Godstar, Godstar. Godstar, Godstar. Godstar, Godstar. God... star.
