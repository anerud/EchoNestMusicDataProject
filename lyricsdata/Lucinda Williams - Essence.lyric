Baby, sweet baby, you're my drug
come on and let me taste your stuff
Baby, sweet baby, bring me your gift
what surprise you gonna hit me with
Refrain:
i am waiting here for more
i am waiting by your door
i am waiting on your back steps
i am waiting in my car
i am waiting at this bar
i am waiting for your essence
Baby, sweet baby, whisper my name
...
