He comes to me
He comes to me and I'm already gone
He doesn't see
He doesn't see that we're hanging on

Blocking out the pieces of today
Trying to get back to yesterday

We're falling away
And there's nothing left but rain
No there's nothing left here
All I hear is silence as I say
We're falling away
We're falling away

Falling away

I go to him
I go to him and he's not really there
...
