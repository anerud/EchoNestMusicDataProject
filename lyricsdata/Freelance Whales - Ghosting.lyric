Do you ever play with kids in the basement
Soot upon your face so you were a hot mess
All your little molars cracked in the pressure

But oh you caught me sleeping in the power sockets
You caught me mildew in the tiles of the bathroom
And oh you shot a glance like I was doing okay
Oh I am never on my way
