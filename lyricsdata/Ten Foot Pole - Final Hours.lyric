I knew the day would come
Maybe this would be the one
Where I would say good-bye
I've tried to understand
The law of supply and demand
But it does no good to wonder why
I wonder if my number is really up this time
There were other times before
When I thought it was over
Somehow I made it this far
Won't be lucky forever
