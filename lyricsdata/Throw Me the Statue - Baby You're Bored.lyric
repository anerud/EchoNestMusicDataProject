Baby you're bored
It's hard to relate
You stall in the light of day
Open wound in the troubled hands
I was keeping one eye focused

Now we feel old
hang as a drape
take our stabs at the plan
Sleeping with the leftest zip code
you found a friend in lost states

Lately those Saturn eyes
lock in apalling shapes
