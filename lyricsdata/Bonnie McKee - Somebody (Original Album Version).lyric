I sit alone, in a dark theater
Watching the people go by
Hand in hand, everybody but me

I stay behind
Watching the credits roll by
Roll, roll, roll right by me

I know I won't cry
Because there is somebody,
Somebody, somebody waiting for me
Out in the rain, won't cry, not tonight
'Cause there is somebody waiting for me

Oh, yeah, won't cry

I take a walk
The streets are busy tonight
And I am searching for you
