So tell me what I pay for the price of freedom
No healthy survival in rooms unattached
Just trying to touch you, but never to hold you
In this burning confusion, with hands made of clay

You've got your hand on my heart
You've got your hand on my heart
You've got your hand on my heart
You've got your hand on my heart

In this prison of nowhere, you've played my emotions
...
