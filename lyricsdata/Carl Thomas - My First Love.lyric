Carl Thomas - My first Love

Ah... Just blazing

verse 1

Back in highschool,
I knew a girl like you,
She was heaven sent,
All the time we spend,
You kinda look like her,
I remember the way we were
Cause we were all in love,
I'm feeling you because...

Hook

You're 5.2,
Brown eyes,
I don't know what to say,
You make me feel that way,
It seems like I'm dreaming,
I can't believe myself,
I found somebody else
