Check the flow clear the way yo
Here come the bro I'm kickin it I know ya
Diggin it the way we swinging it son the
Bossman kickin' my shit wit bass o please
Ya wanna battle whomy shit is still ill
Ill murderize you so what ya gonna do
Get ya ass chopped in two fuckin wit the FU
Bran ya and I swing just like Evander
Real deal and ruff so when ya feeling tuff
Come on kids come on kids brint it!
6 foot 4 with the strength of Sampson
Running over niggars like I'm Rodney Hampton
Say adios when I start to roast
Making most of the mic in my hand
Freak it spooky like a ghost cause

Sum dum monkey bumped his head on
[x3]
