A-N-A-R-C-H-Y!

He says that for the punk rock scene
He'd give his fucking life,
But he only ever paid to see a show once
maybe twice...

Instead he stands outside the halls
And pan handles for beer,
Then sneaks into the hall
To deface the bathroom mirror!

A-N-A-R-C-H-Y!
His name is "captain anarchy",
But only in his mind...
A-N-A-R-C-H-Y!
So punk that he's a poser and he'll be one
...
