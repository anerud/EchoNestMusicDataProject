When the night is closing
Eyes are running wild
Then I hear you humming
All night long

The sign I see it
Tell me am I true
All I need from you is
All I see

This city's paved with cold
Playboys buying fun
Seems there is no hunter left
Without his hunting gun

Can you feel the light
The air is wild open
Oh you see the light it's coming through
It's there in the distance
Always offered to me
Always coming over a hill

Oh your see-saw smile
Lasts me all night long
Like a siren's curl
...
