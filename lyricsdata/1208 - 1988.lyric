I see the tables turning
They turn with speed
I watch the fire burning
Burning to the sea

I heard a holy story
I laughed out loud
A man who chases the wind
Never should be proud

They can always find a way
To pull you down
To make you feel so small, invisible
Another sent to take the final part of me

Give me my lesson for today
I can't hear you
Fill me with hope
