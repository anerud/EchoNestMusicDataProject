Ah, ah, you're beautiful
(Yeah)
Ah, ah, you're beautiful

Hop on the back of my bike
Let the good wind blow through your hair
With an a** like that and a smile so bright
Oh, you're killing me, you know it ain't fair, yeah
Ride on through the middle of the night
Let the moonlight kiss your skin
When you dance like that, your jeans so tight
