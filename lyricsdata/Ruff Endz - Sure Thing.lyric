Ooh.
Yeah'
Play that dance song
I just want you to listen'

Never thought that there could be
Can be a girl for me
Never thought that I could find this kinda love in my lifetime
No I never thought that she can make me so happy
I got the girl of my dreams
I've found my sure thing

You're my thing for long while
Thought I'd never be tied down
Guess I'd never felt anyone ready for real love
If you wanna get real love
Got me thinking my future plans
Makes me wanna step up to the plate and be a good man
Some look forever
And never find the joy I've found in you (ohh)
So true'

You make me wanna do right
Come home to you every night
You've changed my life
Like I'm in love for the first time
(Like i'm in love, I'm in love)
You make me wanna settle down
This love in you I've found
You make me wanna get the ring
Cause I've found my sure thing

(never thought, never thought) Never thought that there could be
Can be a girl for me
Never thought I could find this kinda love in my lifetime
(Never thought) No one never thought that she can make me so happy
