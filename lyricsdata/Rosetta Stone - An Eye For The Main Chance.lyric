There have been many times
Where I've took it upon myself
Your coldness in the face of this
Cannot begin to understand
No explanations
No mix of words
Inspired and lost all at once
It's no different now
It's no different now
To kiss farewell - To close the door
To hang the dream, insist I'm wrong
...
