There's a gap in the 20th century,
and it fills the world with dreams;
When you've got the looks then the rest just works,
if that's what it's like.

Then hold on tight 'til you kindly believe,
Another record shop story that was born to die.
It'll come on real, and we're losing time.

Maybe got swinged from a baby's hand,
too young to understand
...
