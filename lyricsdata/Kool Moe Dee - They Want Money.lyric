I'm drivin'
Benz 190
2.5 and you know where to find me
Driving down the highway
Girlies behind me
Jockin' blindly
No need to remind me
Who I am I know you know me
Stop screamin' and yellin' and pointin' I'm low key
No I ain't got no time for a picture
But slide your number
And I'll get wit ya
You wanna ride
Ya shouldn't of said that
You played yourself
And I know where your head's at
Drive my car don't make me laugh
You better settle for an autograph
Or a hug and a kiss on the cheek maybe
But I ain't trying to make no baby
Forget all the silly rumors you heard
Here's the deal so spread the word
No,
I ain't got no girlfriend
No,
I ain't buy no car
No,
I ain't got no babies
