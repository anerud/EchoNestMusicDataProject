A is for all the times I bit my tongue
B is for bullshit and you fed me some
C is for charity and now you're mine
D is for dollars but you're counting dimes

E is the exit sign backstage at shows
F is my favorite letter, as you know
G is for God loves a patient man
Who spends his days living in ego land

You always write it in the cheapest key
