It's love...
It's love...
Love... get busy
Everybody's talkin all this stuff about me (Now now)
Why don't they just let me live (Oh oh oh)
I don't need permission
Make my own decisions (Oh!)
That's my prerogative

They say I'm crazy
I really don't care
That's my prerogative
They say I'm nasty
But I don't give a damn
Gettin girls is how I live
Some ask me questions
Why am I so real
But they don't understand me
I really don't know the deal
About a brother
Trying hard to make it right
Not long ago
Befo' I win this fight
SING!

Everybody's talkin all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live (Tell me why)
I don't need permission
Make my own decisions (Oh!)
