There's a palace a-fallin' 
There's a smoke in the sky
There's a boy running down into the lowlands tonight
And he's catching a train to where he's heard you have been
He's a fool now among us but a dreamer within
Dreamin' of you

And on that day there was snowfall in the street, yellow light
And they cleared the bill and rails just by those dark shimmer eyes
In that land there's a winter
In that winter's a day
In that day there's a moment when it all goes all your way
