All I Need To Know
The Bigger The Fool (The Harder The Fall)
Her long legs looked like trouble
As she sasheyed through the door
And my mind flashed a warning sign
That I chose to ignore
For the prize I thought I could win
The risk seemed mighty small
The bigger the fool the harder the fall

Fell in love in the heat of passion
Oh, but passion has it's price
