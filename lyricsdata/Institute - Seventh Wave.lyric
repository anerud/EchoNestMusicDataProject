Till the end of time
The world stops
We all stand still
Let the floods come
As they always do
Watch the sun break through
We are memories and signs
Some of what we leave behind
Waiting for the wave
We are fragments made of time
We are broken we are fine

There is something
In repetition
Real life
Not some exhibition

I wouldn't wish it on you
I wouldn't wish it on myself
...
