I sit alone
In the dark theatre watchin' the people go by
hand in hand
everybody but me
oh

I stay behind
watchin' the credits roll by
roll roll roll right by me

I know, I won't cry
cause there is somebody somebody somebody waitin' for me
out in the rain

oh cry
not tonight
because there is somebody waitin' for me
oh yeah

I take a walk
the streets are busy tonight
and I am searching for you
waiting to brush your shoulder
...
