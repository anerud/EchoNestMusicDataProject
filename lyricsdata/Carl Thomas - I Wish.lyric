It was love at first sight
I know from the way she looked at me
Her eyes said it all

Long days and nights, we spent
Until she dropped the bomb on me
When she said that she was unhappily married with children

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
But she got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else

It hurts so bad for sure
