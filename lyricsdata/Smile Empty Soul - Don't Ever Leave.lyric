Half inch fears, ready to bite
Never said you're sorry, 'cause you've always been right
Tell me I'm lame every Saturday night
'cause you drank too many and you wanna fight

All my life, hold my breath
Wonder what trouble is coming next
Hold on tight, through this mess
Sing that song, 'cause you sing it best

La La La La

Hey, I love it when you're spitting in my face
The way you scream when you're breaking all my things
I love the way you put me in my place
Don't ever leave me alone
