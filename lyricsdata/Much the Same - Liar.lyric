His eyes burn like fire, they burn like the sun
He's calling you a liar, he knows that you're the one
The judge will pass his sentence, he'll sacrifice your soul
He won't give you repentance, he'll send you to the gallows pole

Subjected to a means of eternal misery
You've fallen in the shadow of a public mutiny
You listen to your followers, you hear them start to cry
Shouting strains of madness they want you to die
