I just kissed the softest lips that god has ever made
And I am so in love with the girl to whom these lips he gave

Mmmm, soft as a feather on an angels wing
Mmmm, babe, girl you're such a pretty thing
Yes you are
Mmmm, like I'm on a cloud above, yeah
Think I'm falling so in love

I just kissed the softest lips that god has ever made
And I am so in love with the girl to whom these lips he gave
I just kissed the softest lips that god has ever made
...
