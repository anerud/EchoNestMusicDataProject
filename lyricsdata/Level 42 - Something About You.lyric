Ooh ooh
How how can it be that a love
Carved out of caring fashioned by fate
Could suffer so hard
From the games played much too often

Is it so wrong to be human after all

Drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They can't disguise the truth
That there is something about you
