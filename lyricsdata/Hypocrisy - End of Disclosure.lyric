I'm sitting on a moon looking down for you
And watching what you've become
The new world order has a plan for you
A great deception that will make you numb
Fantasy invasion from the sky
Trillions o' dolars from secret funds
Drilling cities undeground
Only for the selected ones
End of disclosure
now the countdown has begun
End of Disclosure
