I saw my boyfriend hanging with this girl that I hate
He didn't have to tell why last night he was late
I can't believe what you tell me
Your lies have come undone
Now I'm living on the road looking out for number one

I took a ride to the city
Had to get out of this place
I just can't stand the pity
When the tears fall down my face
I used to think it was over
But its only just begun
