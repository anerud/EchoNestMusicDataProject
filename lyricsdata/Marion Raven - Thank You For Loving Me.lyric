You look beautiful tonight
As you turn down the light
You could be anywhere with anyone
But you're here with me tonight

Red candle light is glowing in your eyes
The lust is burning too
As you hold me close to you
And you promise me tonight

I'm gonna spend my whole life trying
To keep love from dying on me
I'm gonna spend my whole life faking
...
