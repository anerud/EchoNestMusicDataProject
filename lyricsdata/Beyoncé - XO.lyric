You love is bright as ever
Even in the shadows
Baby kiss me
Before the turn the lights out
Your heart is glowing
And I'm crashing into you
Baby kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Before they turn the lights out
Baby love me lights out

In the darkest night I'll
I'll search through the crowd
Your face is all that I see
I'll give you everything
Baby love me lights out
Baby love me lights out
You can turn my light down
