So glad we made it through the water bane
God gave us land
So hard with contortion lately
I know you understand
A million die and no one really ever knows
They disappear before the sun will ever glow

Hey
Don't be crazed
Cause in a way
We're getting away with everything

All skies run the risk of breaking
They're barely rain
These nights of distortion phase me
How they're all the same
A million die and no one really ever knows
...
