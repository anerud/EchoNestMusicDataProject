Khan...

My name is Nicky, but you can call me Dre
I party through L.A, now baby what you gotta say
(My name is Dre)

(Verse 1)
My name is Nicky, but you can call me Dre
I party through L.A., now baby what you gotta say
I live and lay like Sugar Ray, I listen to Sade
You never see me workin, and yeah freak I like to play, OK?
You're thicker than a can of peanut butter, OK?
Talkin' to another brother, givin' me the eye
Man I can't believe those thighs, shit
I can see the freakin' in your eyes, shit
And if I get you in my court you'll see, I'ma strike for oil
And let me tell you baby girl I'm spoiled
My favorite color's blue, I like the number two
Meanin' that I like to have my cake 'n eat it too
She said, "Do you want a drink Nicky baby?" -"Yeah"
"You want me to get it for you baby?"

Shit- My name is Nicky, but you can call me Dre, what up
I'm only in town for one day, what up
Aretha Franklin tapes I like to play, what up
I can see you like the Tanqueray
