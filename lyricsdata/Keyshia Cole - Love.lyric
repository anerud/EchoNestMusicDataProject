I used think that I wasn't fine enough
And I used to think I wasn't wild enough
But I won't waste my time tryin' to figure out
Why you playin' games, what's this all about?

And I can't believe you're hurting me
I met your girl what a difference
What you seen in her you ain't seen in me
But I guess it was all just make believe

Oh love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin' I found
Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin' I found, found you
