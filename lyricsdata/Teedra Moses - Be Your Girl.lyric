Don't know if you got a girl
Don't mean no disrespect but...
Thoughts of you rule my world
I even dream of you
I swear
visions of you and i

see you all around my way
been meaning to say hi but...
I'm just way too shy
I gotta make you see this is...
more than just a silly crush

(Chorus)
(And I...)
wonder if you even notice me
...
