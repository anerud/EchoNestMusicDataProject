(Piano intro)

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

When you're sad
When your feelin' low
When you're hurt, and don't know where to go
Think of me
An' There I'll be
Anytime you need a friend

When you're down
And your luck runs out
Or if you're in trouble or in doubt
It's okay
To Turn my way
Anytime you need a friend

(Chorus)
