It's good to see the sun
And feel this place
This place I never thought would feel like home

And I ran forever
Far away and I
I always thought I'd end up here alone

Somehow
The world has changed and
I've come home
To give you back the things they took from you

And I feel you now
I'm not alone I'll
Always know where you are
When I see myself I'll always
Know where you are
