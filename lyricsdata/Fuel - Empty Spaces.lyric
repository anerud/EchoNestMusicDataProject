Mister could you maybe lend a hand
To help a drowning, starving, soulless man
Who's eyes are blind and feelings all but numb
Who's ears are all so deaf and mouth is dumb

This is the way, is the way
I fill your spaces now
It's the way, it's the way
Cause all that's been left for me
Is to fight to fill these empty spaces now

Night is day and day is night again
...
