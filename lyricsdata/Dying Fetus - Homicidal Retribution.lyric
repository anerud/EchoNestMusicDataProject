Lost my faith in justice
Time does not heal this pain
Defiled my existence
Recurring nightmare
There's no consolation
The awful memories
Constant mind coercion
Instinctive vengeance
I have nothing left to loose now
Only time, regret and anger
Pain to last a hundred lifetimes
Hatred burning, love extinct
Compound insult of bullshit humanism
Misplaced rights, inflame my rage
Vacant cause, offender the victim
F**k that worthless piece of shit
As long as you live on this earth
Rage unsatisfied
Memories dishonored
Retribution!
