Sleeping awake and awake when I'm sleeping
I've got a dry kind of thirst, when drenched
On sunny days, all I can see is a shadow
And I'm not above being under

And I'm at the brink though I know that I'm empty
And I always hide when it's my turn to seek
My only belief is not to have faith in believing
Before I begin, I'm over
(disconnected)

CHORUS
Broken off again
When I'm only not lonely when I'm lonely by myself
(disconnected)
