I unpacked my chest for you
Do everything that you want me to
Can't believe I gave you all my love
What in the world was I thinkin' of?

I just let it all slip away
With every minute, hour of the day
And if it really meant to be, just share with me
Why do I still feel incomplete?

Tell me, yeah
I need to know, baby
I got to know
Tell me, yeah
Tell me that you love me

If I give you what you need
Would you do the same thing for me?
