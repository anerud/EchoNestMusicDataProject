Guided by my father's call
End of search, I hear them all
Now my quest is to live your dream
Land of the free passed on to me

I hail to thee on precious land
Brave & grand so strong she stands
Reaching from the mountains high
Down to the woods where the ravens fly

To asgaard we fly
The spirit will never die
