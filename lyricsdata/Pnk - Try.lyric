Oh oh
Ever wonder about what he's doing?
How it all turned to lies?
Sometimes I think that it's better
to never ask
whyWhere there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try, and try, and try
Gotta get up and try, and try, and try
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try

Eh, eh, eh
