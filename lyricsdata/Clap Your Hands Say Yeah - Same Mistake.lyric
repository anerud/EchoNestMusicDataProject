On and open road and a virgin kick to chaos
with an angel tattooed to her inner thigh,
wild eyes reflected, and the neon sign.
I did not ask for love,
merely the same mistake

Don't be a fool with that,
your useless plastic pistol,
On my signal, we will drop our stupid
cause and disappear into the night.
As it stands, we're trading potions
for new potions to be swallowed whole.
