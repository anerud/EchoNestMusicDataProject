One trillion dollars could buy a lot of bling
One trillion dollars could buy most anything
One trillion dollars buying bullets, buying guns
One trillion dollars in the hands of killers, thugs

Woah-oh-oh woah-oh woah-oh-oh-oh
Fuck the world a lot of people gotta die tonight
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh woah-oh
Fuck the world
Fuck 'em all

One trillion dollars in Africa, Iraq
One trillion dollars and it's never coming back
...
