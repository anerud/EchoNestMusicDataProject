Sister, I won't let you go, I won't let them take you
Into the silence of a past divided
Brother, keep teaching the power, we only move together
Away from the past that made us fall apart

I refuse to run
And I will die before I kneel
In this life

I refuse to run
And I will die before I kneel
In this life

Systems of profits we punish
With love as our weapon
...
