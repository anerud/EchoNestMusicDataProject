Everybody move to prove the groove
Have you heard it on the news
About this fascist groove thang
Evil men with racist views

Spreading all across the land
Don't just sit there on your ass
Unlock that funky chain dance
Brothers, sisters shoot your best
We don't need this fascist groove thang

Brothers, sisters, we don't need this fascist groove thang

History will repeat itself
Crisis point we're near the hour
Counterforce will do no good
