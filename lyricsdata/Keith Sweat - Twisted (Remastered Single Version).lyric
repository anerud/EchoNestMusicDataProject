Oh yeah baby
You got to make your mind up
Yeah... Kut Klose, hear me out.

(You know you are my lover) You know you are my lover baby
(You got me twisted over you) Girl you've got me twisted over you
(I know I got what you need) I got what you need right here baby
(So what you wanna do)

Baby, baby I know
Baby I love you so
But you don't feel like I do
