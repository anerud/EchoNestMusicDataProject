Boy you know 
You got me really feelin' you 
I don't know what you doing to me 
But keep it up, keep it up 
What you doing to me 
Boy you know 
You got me really feelin' you 
I don't know what you doing to me 
But keep it up, keep it up 
What you doing to me 

I see him almost every day 
I wonder if he has a girl 
But it really don't matter to me 
Cause I've been waiting all this time 
Waiting for the day when I can finally make him mine 
He's mine, he's mine 
All mine so fine, in due time 
I'll be rollin' with him shotgun 
Listening to him tell me baby you're the one, yeah 

Tell me is you feelin' me? 
I like what you do 
Hope you can feel me like I feel you 
Boy you know you really got me going crazy 
Forget about them other girls 
Come and get with me 

Tell me is you feelin' me? 
I like what you do 
Hope you can feel me like I feel you 
Boy you know you really got me going crazy
