All my love is around me
Like virgins clean today
Waist deep in the water
Pushing my body away

A wall makes me go
To pull past to me
Oh how many drops can you squeeze out to explain
What happened Monday?

And tell me from afar
I saw how I slither
Like colors in the dark

But when dark kisses me
I was half a world away
It seems shorty is my bred
As I turn to say
