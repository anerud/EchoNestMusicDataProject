allen / cox / gray
Face the facts and don't look back
There's a hole in this middle town affair
There's a whole inquest
Like a hole in the rest
That I think I'm going to have to sit in
You're a sleeping bag
You're a rhyming slug

Pressure pressure

Man is sick of chairs
From the heart of the sins above ground
Around here I think I'm Jesus
