You're the only one looking out for you
Everyone else is looking for second chances

After all the things that you go through
They want to pawn off all their problems
They can't solve on you

I don't want to feel the weight of the world

There's too much pressure but there's time
To find a better way to speak my mind
Than complaining and whining
It's your pressure you're defining
