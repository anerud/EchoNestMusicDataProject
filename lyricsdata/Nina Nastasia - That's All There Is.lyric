My dreams have come and gone 
The world is spinning faster each day 
And I am not the one 
My future promised I'd be 
I'm not hiding anything 
I'm not trying to fool you at all 
You keep expecting everything 
We're not like our pictures on the wall 
There's nothing wrong with us 
We still belong 

But that's all there is 
...
