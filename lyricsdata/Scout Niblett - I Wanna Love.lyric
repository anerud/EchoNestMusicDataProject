Just hear the rain down
I wish that you were near me
There's no one else the rain down
I wish that you could hear me

I know you've got to have pain
In order to grow
I think I am ready darling
I will accept them clothes

My body tends toward happy
My heart longs for something new
Sometimes you got to have it
That's the way I feel about you
