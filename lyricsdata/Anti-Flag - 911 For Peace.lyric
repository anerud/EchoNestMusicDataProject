It's in the paper every day
You see it in the headlines
And you feel so sick, yeah
'Cause another life leaves this world, this world

So full of hate but short
Short on compassion, short on humanity
I think enough in vain, shaken by the shock
"Do we even have a chance?"

I don't wanna die, I don't wanna kill
I don't wanna kill, I don't wanna die
We are all human
It's time to prove it

I don't wanna die, I don't wanna kill
I don't wanna kill, I don't wanna die
We are all human
It's time to prove it, yeah

This is a plea for peace, world peace
To the oppressors of the world, yeah
To the leaders of nations
Corporate profit takers

To the every day citizen
Greed, envy, fear, hate
...
