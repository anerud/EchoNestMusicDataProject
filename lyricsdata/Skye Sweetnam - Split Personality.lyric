I am taking you over to the dark side of rock n roll

I'd like you to meet
The other side of me
Gotta getcha, gotta getcha, gotta getcha

When it's time to rock
She's a celebrity
Gotta getcha, gotta getcha, gotta getcha
I got you, I got you

And now she's got me

[Chorus]
She drowns me out
When I shout
I'm so overpowered
I cannot hide
From the opposite side
