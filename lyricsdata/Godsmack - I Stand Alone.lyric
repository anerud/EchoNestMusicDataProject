I've told you this once before
Can't control me
If you try to take me down
You're gonna break
I feel your every nothing that you're doing for me
I'm thinking you ought to make your own way

I stand alone
Inside
I stand alone

You're always hiding behind your so-called goddess
So what
You don't think that we can see your face
Resurrected back before the final falling
I'll never rest until I can make my own way
(I'm not afraid of fading)
