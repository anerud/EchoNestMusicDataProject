I'm tripping into the back of my mind
And your words like angels crash inside
And a word and a movement and a touch
And a word and a movement and it's all too much
It's all too much

I never understood what it meant to be
I never understood what it meant to be misunderstood
And even if I did, I don't think I'd care less
And even if I did, I don't think I'd care less

You're so beautiful
You're so beautiful
...
