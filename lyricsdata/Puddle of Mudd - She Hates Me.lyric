Met a girl, thought she was grand
Fell in love, found out first hand
Went well for a week or two
Then it all came un-glued

In a trap, trip I can't grip
Never thought
I'd be the one who would slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie

She fuckin' hates me
Trust
She fuckin' hates me
La, la, la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

She was queen for about an hour
