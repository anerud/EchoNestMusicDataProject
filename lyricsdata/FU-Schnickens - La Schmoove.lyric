La Schmoove, yo we don't got nuttin to prove Yo, when I was small they used to tease me
because my hair was peasy, hard and greasy
But now I'm livin well like George and Wheezy
So easy (WHAT?) does it (YO!)
Is it, because I'm, rockin - beats, beats, beats
Fu-Manchu'n cause I'm doin what just had to be done
Now we in there like swimwear, girls callin me hon
Give me hugs, little peck, mucho tongue, lots of sex
Nuff respects to my bros that live on five-six street RIGHT
I'm smashin monster mashin boom bashin in a fashion
which is wild now I smile when I whip-lash MC's with my style
Call me Cuckoo, I'm makin buku, bucks
I'm geared and fully prepared to tear all MC's that are, smuks
For bros who sleep and cavity creep and listen when I talk
as I soothe in the groove, cause I'm smooth like Mr. Rourke
Doobely-zoo Mr. Wu, no need to be rude, but F.U.
cause I ain't got nuttin to prove

La Schmoove, yo we don't got nuttin to prove 'Leave it to Beaver'-arriva, derci
Heavens to mercy ba FU sayanora
adios muchachos dorme vous unbuckle my Fu-Schnick shoe
Mr., Chip Fu, about to wreck shop
With the Judo (CHOP!) a Judo (CHOP!) a Judo chop CHOP!
Yo, zilch kaput me nada none son
I don't think so, so take a look at
a Superfly big Jimmy the Honeynut Cheerio Bee
ba schnicker bah snchnucker
I ams what I ams that's all what I ams
My lyrics are never done
I'm the big John Elmer Glue the Elmer the Fudd
Al Bundy the Bud Light stud
Come like tongues lashes, with the quickness
Moc and Poc is, my witness
Ask the Kung about my tongue and the styles that I brung instead
I'm the Ali Babi cutty rankin shuba-dib-da-dabble
