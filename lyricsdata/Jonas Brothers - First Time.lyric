Such a thrill, of a lifetime
What a night, for a good time
The beat, be your lifeline
Make it feel, like the first time

Oh-oo Oh Oh-oo Oh Oh
Make it feel like the first time
Oh-oo Oh Oh-oo Oh Oh
Make it feel like the first time
Come on let it set you free
Right here right now where you're suppose to be
Oh-oo Oh Oh-oo Oh Oh
Make it feel like the first time
