Lost in my own world
Lost in my own world
Lost in my

Lost in my own world
Lost in my own world
Lost in my

Getting to the right
Getting to the wrong
Getting mine

Getting to the right
Getting to the wrong
Getting high

Losing your mind
Losing your mind
It's blurring
It's fading
Your soul's on fire
It's black and white

Burning inside
Burning inside
Burning into white

Burning inside
Burning inside
Burning into night
