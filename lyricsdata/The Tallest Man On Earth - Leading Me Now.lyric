By the eyes of the very young
It's a sudden good attack
Born of the weakness my oys and I
Carry anger forth and back
But we'll make it somehow
You've all what's mine
And your leading me now

On the gallop to mother's few
We will lose our breath and fight
And you give me the look of thorns
We get liars every night
