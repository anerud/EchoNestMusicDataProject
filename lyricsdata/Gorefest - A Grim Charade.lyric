A grim charade, this jester's race.
Its bleakness washes over me.
This overpowered farce, technocratic state.
Needs to be put back into its place.
All the shit you throw now comes back at you.

That's when you wake up and realise
That this war cannot be won.
The truth hits hard, the walls come down.
