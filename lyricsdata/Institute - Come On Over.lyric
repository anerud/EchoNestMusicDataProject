Steal your love
As the good die young
Take what's yours
Before they come

All the right moves might
Still leave you in the wrong place
The strangest beauty's in the strangest places
Strangest beauty's in the empty spaces

Come on through
Come on over
You'd better not run or they shoot you down
And they're all over this town

Take your shot
...
