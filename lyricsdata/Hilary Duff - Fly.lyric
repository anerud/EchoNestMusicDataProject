In a moment, everything can change
Feel the wind on your shoulders
For a minute, all the world can wait
Let go of your yesterday

Can you hear it calling
Can you feel it in your soul
Can you trust this longing
And take control

Fly
Open up the part of you that wants to hide away
You can shine
Forget about the reasons why you can't in life
And start to try
Cause it's your time
Time to fly
