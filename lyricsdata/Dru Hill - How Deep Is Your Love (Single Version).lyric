How deep is your love for me?
Tell me what it's gonna be
Or do you see yourself fuckin'
With a nigga like me?
On the low though
So your friends won't know now me

How deep is your love for me?
Tell me what it's gonna be
Or do you see yourself fuckin'
With a nigga like me?
On the low though
So your friends won't know now me

Hey, Mami, you know that I like it
When you call me Papi
But it seems like lately, baby
That you've been seein' another chico

And baby, you know he can't go down like me
You know that a nigga can't freak like me
So Mami, tell me one little thing
How deep is your love for me?

How deep is your love for me?
Tell me what it's gonna be
Or do you see yourself fuckin'
With a nigga like me?
On the low though
So your friends won't know now me

How deep is your love for me?
Tell me what it's gonna be
Or do you see yourself fuckin'
With a nigga like me?
On the low though
So your friends won't know now me

Ven aqui Mami, Puerto Rican, I see
The way you wiggle it
The way you move your body
He can't make you get wetter than me
But I bet he keeps tellin' you
He's better than me
