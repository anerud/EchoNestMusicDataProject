The sound of God is the screech of tires
Lights and magnets, bolts and wires
Strayed from the road, this very one
Still to come

The sound of tires is the sound of God
The electric version
Power and blood will pulse through your song
Just as long as it
Sounds lost
Sounds lost
Sounds lost

Streaming out of the magnets

Strung together like Christmas lights
...
