High on a hill
Heard a bird sing her song
Sang you were true
Well, she got it all wrong

She didn't know about you're Lies
And all you're stupid alibis
Don't you know, this bird got wise
Surprise surprise surprise

The writings one the wall
Yeah yeah
In letters written tall
Yeah yeah
I thought I'd let you know before I go
I will see you crawl

Fell of the hill
