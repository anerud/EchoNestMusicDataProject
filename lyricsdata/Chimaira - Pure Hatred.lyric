I have told you things need to change
You never listened or came to my aid
The vicious cycle has not changed
My time's spent rearranged

Motherfuck it all
I can't stand this
Remember when I said
Everyone makes me sick
Well nothing has changed

I hate everyone
I hate everyone

This vicious cycle still remains
Constant clusterfuck, bloodstains
