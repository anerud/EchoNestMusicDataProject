Ah yea
Whole world
MCs
Whose slick?

We lounge stay phat notice our G limp
A natural flair with our fresh ass hair
Style baggy out clouts slick
Creamy and fresh east coast to west

Brooklyn
Uptown
To the universal fair
Old school MCs

I'm slicker this year, I'm slicker this year
Myrtle Ave A train got the pic in my hair
And what 16 joints later still lounge
Fresh, from flatbush in my baggy booster gets

Style is tight ees bust the cami' fatigues
50, 000 leagues of black, so what's up
Can we avenue slide player style ghetto walk
To the east and wild Crooklyn, New york

Creamy kid yo Smith and Wesson win a blessing
The angular slang blow spots, bang, 11
Hangin' like bats,'cause the 12 inch wax
Say scorpio and my hair say 'fro

And my blood say bro, my clics say, "Eh, yo!"
Make sparks from the barrel me tal pistol
To the depths I dive seems lunar like aqua
The cool blast mega we black we wild flowers

Scott La Rock had emm all, I gots the ball
And roll a little panthers through these project halls
The 3 color flag can't hold my baggys sag
