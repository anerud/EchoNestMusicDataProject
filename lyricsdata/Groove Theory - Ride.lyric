Can we go, can we go, can we go, oh, oh?
Can we go, can we go, can we go, oh, oh?
(Yeah)

I've been here a long time
Seein' the same kinda things go on
Over and over
What I got on my mind it won't really take too long
So tell me if you're open
(For takin' a ride for an hour or two)
(Ooo)
Make it fast or make it slow
(Baby, that's all that I'm askin' of you)
Break my heart if you say no

I wonder can we go for a ride
(With you baby)
(I wanna ride with you baby)
(Go for a ride with you)
I wonder can we go for a ride
(With you baby)
(Go for a ride with you)

Meet you in the mornin'
So we can make it last all day
Sunrise till sundown
You just say you're comin'
 (Ooo)
I'll bring music for along the way
Cruisin' to the sweet sounds
(Baby, if you don't feel like talking)
Baby, that's all right
(I'll just sit beside you)
And watch the world go by
 (Ooo)

I wonder can we go for a ride
(With you baby)
Aah, aah
(With you baby)
Yeah, yeah
