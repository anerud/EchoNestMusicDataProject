Originally a fleetwood mac song!
Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom
Well who am I to keep you down
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound, of your loneliness
Like a heartbeat. drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost, yeah what you had, and what you lost

Yeah, thunder only happens when it's raining
