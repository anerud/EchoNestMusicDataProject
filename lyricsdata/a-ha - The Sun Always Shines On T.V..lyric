Touch me
How can it be?
Believe me
The sun always shines on TV
Hold me
Close to your heart
Touch me
And give all your love to me
To me

I reached inside myself and found
Nothing there to ease the pressure off
My ever-worried mind
All my powers waste away
I fear the crazed and lonely looks
The mirror's sending me these days
