Lost in your own conviction
Being lead from outside eyes
Perceiving success as malevolent
At the expense of others
Defiance with hands out
Claiming the bribes as plunder
Images presented certainty
Driving thoughts that despise
Subservient, obedient
Wanting to preserve the cause
Tag along within the pack
Acceptable behavior stick to the mantra
