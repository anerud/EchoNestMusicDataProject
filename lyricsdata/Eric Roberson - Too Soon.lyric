Ooh, really can't explain girl the way I feel, no
All I know is all I want you to be near, yeah
I know that it's due
But please be patient, I'm learning you
And all I want is you to learn me too

So girl when I say
(Say)
Say girl let's take our time
(Time)
Understand girl that I'm
(That I'm)

I'm not offering game
(Game)
Hopefully girl in time
(Time)
How you and I deal with change
(Change)

It's soon to say I love you
It's soon to say I love you
It's soon to say I love you

I can say it to make your heart feel good, ooh
But it's best that we are both understood, yeah
It's important that I'm the same way
For you right down the line
And that you see is what I want to shine
