Intro)
Hmm, yeah
(I miss you baby)
I been missin' you
(It's so hard bein' away from you)
Girl, I been missin' you, baby
(Mmm, I want you next to me so bad)
I been thinking about you girl
(I miss you so much girl)

I never felt loneliness like this before
I'm so paranoid
Thinkin' you gonna walk through the door
Girl my heart has so much pain to endure
It's been hurting for so long 'til it feels sore

Girl I don't wanna hurt no more
You're everything worth living for
So baby come back to me
You belong with me naturally
Take me outta my misery
Girl I'm going crazy

1 - Girl I been missing you, like crazy
Every minute seems like hours
