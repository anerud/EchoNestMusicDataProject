So it is you, you think you'll get away with the same thing again
Yup

Dance with me
I love the way you shake your lil' body for me
Come on what's my name uh, say my name come on, come on
Dance with me
I love the way you shake your lil' body for me
Come on say what's my name, come on come on, say my name

Let me whisk you away
Better yet some fries and a shake
Come on girl now don't be late
Just kiddin'
'Cause you like that baller shit
That negative degrees on the arm and shit
Better hop in the hoop with that prada shit
'Cause I ain't havin' it
Girl I can handle it

Or maybe we can do a little cha-cha
We can do a little ah-ah
Gotta go
But before I gotta go
You gotta know you got a body like whoa
Or maybe we can do a little ah-ah
Right before we do the cha-cha
Lemme know
But before you let me know I gotta make this last forever

Dance for me
I love the way you shake your lil' body for me
Oh your eyes
Take over me
They holdin' me
Fell like they controllin' me
Moanin' me oh

Dance for me
I love the way you shake your lil' body for me
Oh your eyes
Take over me
They holdin' me
Fell like they controllin' me
Moanin' me oh

Baby I like when you shake it
