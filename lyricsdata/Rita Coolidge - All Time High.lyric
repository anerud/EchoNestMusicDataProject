All I wanted was a sweet distraction for an hour or two
Had no intention to do the things we've done
Funny how it always goes with love, when you don't look, you find
But then we're two of a kind, we move as one

We're in all time high
We'll change all that's gone before
Doing so much more than falling in love
On an all time high
