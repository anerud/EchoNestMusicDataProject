alright!
i'm over by the water cooler
listen to the chatter
while i'm working to get fired but it doesn't seem to matter
when the week is nearly through
but i find something to do
cause the end is coming soon
yeah the end is coming

alright!
alright!
well alright!
alright!

put the days together and they start to do some damage
if the mean is in the middle then i know that i will manage
...
