Lonely Night, I cry myself to sleep
Tell me, what am I gonna do

?'Cause it's always been you to dry my tears
It's always been you to wash away my fears
It's always been you each night and day
Now what can I say when love slips away?

Lonely night, I'm walking the floor
Tell me, what am I gonna do

Without your precious love, your tender touch
Hey, Little Girl, I miss you so much
Wish we could turn back the hands of time
To the day when you were mine
