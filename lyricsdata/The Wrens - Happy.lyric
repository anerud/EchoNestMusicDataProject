You know what I'm saying?

Happy
It's so nice to be happy
Everybody should be happy
It's so nice to be happy

Happy
It's so nice to be happy
It's so nice to be happy
It's so nice to be happy

I wanna take you to my world to be happy
'Cause i can't live without your love
Yes you know

I've nevere needed anyone to be happy
But that's the way that things go wrong
Yes you know
