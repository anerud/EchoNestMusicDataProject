When I see the moon, I hear the sound of the strip
Just calling my name
Just calling my name
When I see the moon, I hear the sound of the strip
Just calling my name
Yeah it's calling my name

Man I love the feeling
When I go out
Dancing with the women at the bar
Man I love the feeling
When I go out
I always know my woman's close somewhere
