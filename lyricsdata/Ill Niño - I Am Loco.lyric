Life is weighing down on me, killing me inside
Something I could never be will guide me to the new
Light
Frustrated
Sedated
I pray to myself

God please
Don't take away from me

The only fucking thing
That I learned to believe
I am becoming the monster
You promised to keep him away
Now I feel like he's living in me!

Anyway, I could never ever be
What you think is right for me
Are things that I will not believe
...
