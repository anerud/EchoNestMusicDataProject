I went outside to take a walk
So I could relive memories
I thought that you would lend a hand
But you were never ever there

It's all in your mind
You do what you wanna do

Your promises are all played out
You've got your wish
You've worn me down
I've treated you the best I could
I realize that I don't need you

I lost my way when you left home
I thought that you could change your life
...
