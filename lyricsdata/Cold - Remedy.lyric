I don't love how you love
But please dont leave me here alone
I don't feel how you feel
Well it's my fault I'm bones
I don't die how you die
I can't just waste away
You keep changing your life
Everyday

If it burns I'll keep fueling the same dream
If you fall I'll remember to save game
I don't want your remedy

I don't fall how you fall
I wont hold on, you cant let go
Well it's pain that I feared
...
