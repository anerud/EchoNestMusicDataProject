(Talk)
Good evening
Welcome to channel 187 Murder 1 News
Tonight we focus on the city of Vallejo in the state of California
Where five black men were found dead at the water front
From various gunshot wounds
This brings the homicide rate in the state of California to one of the
highest in the nation
And is now known to you as killa kali

(Verse 1)
The state of California niggas call it killa kali
Murder weapons in the river bodies found in the alleys
Bring the yellow tape
Body bags gettin zipped up
Heads blown off wit they insides ripped up
Mobile phones flipped up
Factors callin shots
Bitch made niggas its some real niggas on the block
Cause every hood got a trigga happy nigga
That don't give a f**k about puttin two in your liver
But how you figure you can do dirt and stay clean
Niggas like that get pronounced dead on the scene
Aint no winnin teams cause everybody taken losses in they hood
Reminiscin on they niggas man I wish I could
Bring back the homies that I lost up in that funk season
Gotta check myself or let that alcohol be the reason
So I just poor a little liquor on the concrete
For my dead homies and the ones who aint gone see the streets
Locked up with the rest of the locs
But whatever the reason my folks are walkin the yard
Or gettin they guts some
Tryin to make it home but I think they
Safer in that pin cause niggas on gin be lettin them Mack 10's
Bust 32 times
And niggas who aint in it gettin shot by
Standards on the block
Smokin like bomb
Fools given up they cell
Gettin sideways leaven them t-shirts soakin wet
Retaliation is a must
So now you know them niggas you was funkin wit
Gone be at yo do so
Keep yo hand on yo nina in the valley
Or get dumped in the alley
F**kin around in killa kali

(Chorus 1)
Mothers on they knees
