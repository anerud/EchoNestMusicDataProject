When nothing you say is heard
and nobody cares if you hurt
I know how it seems, hear nothing but screams
But take it from me it's not the end

When all that you try goes wrong
Heard nothing but lies for so long
I know how it seems, it's hard to believe
But take it from me it's not the end

Stuck keep moving stuck

Don't let it die
...
