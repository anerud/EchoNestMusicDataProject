Drop some new shit on 'em them
Let's drop some new shit on 'em

Drop it on 'em Cas

Some brand new new shit
Going

Yeah, this D-E-L in the house
And Hieroglyphics crew
Down wit' Matt Kelly, A-Plus, Domino
Man, we about to kick this little shit right here on my down time on the
album
Check it out

MC's is too promiscious so if you fuss
I'ma be the next to bust and take you on the Exodus
Wreckless
