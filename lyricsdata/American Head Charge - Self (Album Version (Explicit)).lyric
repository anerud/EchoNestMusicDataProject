No sense of self
To balance it off

Preconceived notions of something
That everyones gone

Will I show up
With all that I have to give
Would you consider it a gift

But that
Doesnt matter anyway
It doesnt matter anyway
It doesnt matter anyway you
Liar
You're such a
Liar

On your hands and knees
Picking up the broken pieces
Liar
You're such a
Liar
