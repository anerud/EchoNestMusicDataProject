(Verse 1)
I had a dream we,
slow dancing to the ocean waves
under a half exposed moon,
so secure
If we stay in here forever we
still would have to go
go and leave too soon
(Chorus)
but it's all, just a dream
the next day, you didn't know me
and it's all, oh just a dream
the next day, you didn't hold me
and it hurts, hurt so bad
