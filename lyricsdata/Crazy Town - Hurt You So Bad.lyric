Now let me state it for the record
I'm jaded but when you looked at me
I couldn't escape it
I really hate it when I'm out of control
But baby after the show
My mind just wouldn't let go
Tell me was it a hallucination
That made me feel so alone
And even though I have never met you before
I can't get you out of my head
Now I'm pouring out my heart for you
