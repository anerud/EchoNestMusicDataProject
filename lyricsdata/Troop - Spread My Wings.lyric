Verse I

I've imagined faces of many lovers
To ease the pain of having no one
In My Life.
And i'm tried of being undercover...
It's time to Navigate my feelings tonight...

Hook:
The sky is calm
The stars are bright.
What's better than to be in flight.
I'll relax my mind
And be at ease...
and let this journey
Set me free
...
