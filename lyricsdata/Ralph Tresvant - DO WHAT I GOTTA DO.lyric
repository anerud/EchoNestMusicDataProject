Ah... ah... (Whoa... oh...)
Ah... ah...
Ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... (So, so hard, girl)
Ah... ah... (I gotta)

Mmm...
I'm ‘bout to do this
Oh, I guess it's one of those things a man just has to do
But I promise
It'll work out for the better, baby
Trust me

Ah... ha...
Ah... ah... (I gotta)

I've been feelin' lately like bein' single or just alone
To get into myself
Love ain't easy, makin' me crazy, games that we play
Sometimes the rules have to change

I don't wanna treat her cruel
But I like honesty
So what am I gonna do

I guess I'll do what I gotta do
And break her heart
I don't wanna see her cry
But it's hard to live a lie

So I gotta do what I gotta do
And break her heart
...
