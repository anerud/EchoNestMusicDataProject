We're going down the tubes
To the underground
What we gone and done
We're getting to the point
Where nothing seems to work anymore
If tolerance is dead
There'll be no rest for the living
Imagine no trouble
And a little respite
This boombox needs batteries
This boombox needs batteries
Lovers and dangerous love
We'll find a way through everything
Sick at the thought of losing you
No one else to my room
Soft as it slowly comes
You move like electric window
We take love whenever it comes
To the world that we have run
...
