Back To Me Lyrics

I've got ways to make you sorry
Start my life with someone else
I've got ways to make you fall
Tell you all the things that I lied about
I've got ways to make you mad
Just laughing at the girl sittin on your lap
I've got ways to make you sing my songs
The ones I ain't written yet

I've got plots you've never seen
I've got moves I've never used
I've got ways to make you come
Back to me
