Dance, locust, dance
The prophets shrug their shoulders as
Calamity's child lost her head
In the bell of the trumpet blast

I know you just wanna be on fire
I know you just wanna be on fire

Jam, radio, jam
Power to the pirate stations
Broadcasting up through
The flowery cracks in the pavement

I know you just wanna be on fire
I know you just wanna be on fire
...
