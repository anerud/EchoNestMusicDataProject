I hunt you this night, this is your sacrifice
I saw you in my morbid dreams
You should be the one who may feel my lust
I drift you around from place to place no time to rest
I'll show you my anger to night I'm your savage butcher

Slaughtered corpse Hanged up with ropes
Slaughtered corpse Worst dismemberment
