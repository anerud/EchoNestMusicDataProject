Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm

I wish I didn't feel it
I know it just ain't right
But it seems to pop up in my head
Morning, noon and night

I just can't release it
The memory of you
Mama never told me
Love would leave me so damn blue

And I got misery
'Cause I know loving you's a sin
And I'll be on my knees
Praying that I don't give in

Now baby you and me
Never ever could have been
Till I got misery
Because I'll love you till the end

You said that you loved me
But I'm your only one
...
