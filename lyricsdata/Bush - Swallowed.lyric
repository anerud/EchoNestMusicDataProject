Warm sun, feed me up
And I'm leery, loaded up
Loathing, for a change
And I slip some, boil away

Swallowed, followed
Heavy 'bout everything but my love
Swallowed, sorrowed
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet

Just wanted to be myself
Hey you said you would, love to try some
Hey you said you would love to die some
In the middle of a world on a fishhook
