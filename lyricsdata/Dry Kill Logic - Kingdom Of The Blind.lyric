(Verse 1)

Descend, alone in this world, been forgotten
(forgotten x 2)
If only we had been more certain.
Now I have given everything this last time
(the last time x 2)
And taking nothing back in return...

(Pre-chorus)

You don't make me... What I am...

(Chorus)

In my eyes, you're blinded
You'll never be anything at all
In your eyes, reminded
Purest enemy, too far gone
...
