Just a small town girl livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

A singer in a crowded room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can put on a show
That goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting up and down the boulevard
...
