I am so unlike you in so many ways
I know I'm just a copy that carries on the stain

But we make the same mistake
'Cause we are one and the same
But we leave behind the stain
That cannot separate

All that lies in me
All that dies in me
How can I live without you?
All that lies in me
All that dies in me
How can I live without you?

I am your mirror image of all you left behind
You made me what I am and who the hell am I?
