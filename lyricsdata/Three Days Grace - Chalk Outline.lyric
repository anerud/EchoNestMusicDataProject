I've been cursed
I've been crossed
I've been beaten by the ones
That get me off

I've been cut
I've been opened up
I've been shattered by the ones
I thought I loved

You left me here
Like a chalk outline
On the sidewalk
Waiting for the rain to
Wash away
(Wash away)

You keep coming back
To the scene of the crime
But the dead can't speak
And there's nothing left to say
Anyway
All you left behind
...
