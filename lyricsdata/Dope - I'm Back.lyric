Bush: "Trusting in the sanity and restraint of the United States is not an option."

I'm back to put it in motion
I'm back to tell you no lies
Sit back and sip on this notion
I'm back to put it in drive
I'm back watch out I'm back
What ya gonna do
I'm back to cause a commotion
I'm back to demoralize
Sit back and feel the emotion
I'm back to keep it alive
I'm back watch out I'm back

What ya gonna do
When the sound goes boom
