Hello darkness, come on in
Let me light a candle
Imaginations runnin'
Hands start to tremble

Knows enough to know not to believe
What is real and what it seems to be
Knows what's keepin' him from bein' free
Right outside your door

Don't run away
Red headed stepchild
I can only promise
You won't find your way back home

In another room there's laughin'
Entertainin' strangers
...
