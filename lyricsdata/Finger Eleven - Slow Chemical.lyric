The wonder of the world
Is gone, I know for sure
All the wonder that I
Would have found in her
As a whole becomes
Another strike to burn
An old flame returns

Every intuition fails
To find it's way
One more table turned
Around I'm back again
Finding I'm a lost and found
When she's not around
When she's not around
I feel it coming down
