Ohh
Packin' up my shh... and I'm goin' real far
Goin' off to Hollywood to be a big star
It's nothin' here for me so I gotta move fast
And I'm gettin' on the road and wont never look back
Hey...

I gotta dream big
'Cause when it happens, it's gone happen real big
Yes I feel it, ohh
I gotta move fast
'Cause when it happens, I can't let it go past
Only get one chance
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh,
