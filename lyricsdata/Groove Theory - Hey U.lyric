Hey U
I hope you know what I been goin' through, baby
I wonder if you're goin' through it too
But I'm afraid to face what might be true, hey u

I remember the day
It hit me that I really loved you way
I thought for sure I'd be here to stay baby
To my surprise I'd soon be running away, running away

If I ever see you walkin'
I won't know what to say, or do
So what's the use in talkin'
All that's left to say is, hey U, hey U

Those times, were some of the happiest in life
I count the years since I left you behind
