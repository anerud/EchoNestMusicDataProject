Are you ugly?
A liar like me?
A user, a lost soul?
Someone you don't know
Money it's no cure
A sickness so pure
Are you like me?
Are you ugly?

We are dirt, we are alone
You know we're far from sober
We are fake, we are afraid
You know it's far from over
We are dirt we are alone
You know we're far from sober
Look closer, are you like me?
Are you ugly?
