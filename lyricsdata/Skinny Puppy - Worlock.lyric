(Now is the only thing that's real)

Binge
Cringe
On the fringe (The police used to watch over the people. Now they're watching the people)
Sloppy
Binge
Cringe (Now is the only thing that's real.)
Sloppy
Mincing
Eye-dropping
Biopsy
Cyclops overlooks
Optic options
Rotten showstopper
Skinpopper
Babbler dabbler
Self confessed criminal tore pen in vain
Instant still spellbound
Game stock talk back rock
Reencounter incident
Subsistence inexistent (Now is the only thing that's real.)
Non committed
Unwitted
Oblivious
Habitual
Resistor
Roughed up edge fluent nudge pre-collect ignition
Motivation
Inexistent
Wasted views that's all they see blue
