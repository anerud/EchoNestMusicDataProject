Didn't you know?
I always said I'd be by myself
Never wanted no man's money
Didn't need no help
There was a time I was all for love
But all it took was one heartbreak and I'd had enough

Just when I thought I had no reason
You come along and showed me life has just begun

(Chorus)
Didja know, I would go
Anywhere you roll cause with you it's home
Didja know it, didja know it
Didja know it, didja know it
Does it show, When I'm low
