Vagabond haze
You get lost when you find hope in a feeling
You've been estranged
You've been a far away child
All you need is four little problems solved,
Where you go they follow
Slow the breathing first and burn the lock
Get that action
Can't you see?
Throw the ashes on my shore
I'll return in time
I know your noises
...
