Adventurers
Stab the days and wipe the blade let’s put the magazines away
Breaking rules and scamming trips doing anything to scratch the itch
We’ll run away run away run away from a life imbalanced
Don’t fuck with the last adventurers
We’re never gonna let this go
We wont have to
With brains in our head feet in our shoes
Passport control ditching the real life
Tight mountain roads that tunnel into coastal city lights
