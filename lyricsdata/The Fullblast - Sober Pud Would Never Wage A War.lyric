Let's play a game
Let's see how still we can lay until the heat between us forces us to move
Let'f fall in love I know you've got what I want 
Moistened lips, your swinging your hips
The morning will soon be nigh
Can't it wait for now?
We both know I'm leaving soon
Can't it wait for now?
You sing the perfect melody
Your heart keeps a perfect beat
