[Intro]
Neverrr know how much I love you (woo!)
Neverrr know how much I care (No I.D.)
And when you put your arms around me
I get the fever that's so hard to bare
You give me fever

[Rhymefest]
Uhh, here go that arrogant, stuffy head, cold leave you achin
from asses ah-shakin all night to rest well medicine
It's that {FE-VER} take two of these, call me in the mornin
You gon' still feel sick, cause it's that {give you that fever}
I give 'em all the plague, I'm awfully paid
And still make a cold starve for days
Never the type that ran, whatever the fight I'm in
You half-hearted, but I take this medicine like a man
For that {FE-VER} that keep these niggaz sweatin bullets
Clack clack, naw them the ones that you caught for tryin to pull it
This that {FE-VER} somebody warn the industry
'Fest on FIRE, and burnin in the third degree
'Til they murder me, five-oh get no words from me
And if they do then that's perjury

[Chorus]
{FE-VER} Hot like hot sauce
Uhh, we got we got that fe-verrr
