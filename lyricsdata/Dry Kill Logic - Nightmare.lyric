I don't like you
Something strange I cannot follow
Now you want me to
However small it seems so shallow
If you only knew
Such a feeling for words so hollow
What I'd done to you
You'd cry

Me + you = nightmare, I say
Me + you = nightmare
Me + you = nightmare, I say
Me + you = nightmare

You took it all away
