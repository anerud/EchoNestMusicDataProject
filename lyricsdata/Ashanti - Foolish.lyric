See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on runnin' back to you

See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on runnin' back to you

Baby, I don't know why ya treatin' me so bad
You said you loved me, no one above me and I was all you had
And though my heart is eating for you, I can't stop cryin'
I don't know how I allow you to treat me this way yet still I stay?

See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on runnin' back to you

See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
...
