Once upon a time I believed I could change the world but I was wrong
Finding solace in the vitriol and the anti-social context for so long

Cursed to keep gazing backward
And never never look ahead
A pitchfork of a destination
Submerged in a sea of red

These nightmares never go away
Still bound by chains of self decay
To simply saturate and bleed
Out the seeds of a new address
We're charged with the destruction of those static molds
We choose to build a union from the old
