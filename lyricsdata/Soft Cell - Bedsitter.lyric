Sunday morning going slow
I'm talking to the radio
Clothes and records on the floor
The memories of the night before
Out in club land having fun
And now I'm hiding from the sun
Waiting for a visitor
Though no-one knows I'm here for sure

Dancing laughing
Drinking loving
And now I'm all alone
In bedsit land
My only home
