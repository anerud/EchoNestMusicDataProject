Oh, naive little me
Asking what things you have seen
You're vulnerable in your head
You'll scream and you'll wail till you're dead

Creatures veiled by night
Following things that aren't right
And they're tired and they need to be led
Or you'll scream and you'll wail till you're dead

But give me to a rambling man
Let it always be known that I was who I am
