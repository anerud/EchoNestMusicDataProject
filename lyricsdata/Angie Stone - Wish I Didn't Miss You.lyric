Same old story back again
she's not a lover
she's just a friend
I'm sick and tired for you to blame on me
now you think it's funny
now you wanna spend your money on girls
but you forgot when you were down
that I was around

Call my lover, hang up, call again
what in the world is happening
listen in, but don't yell at me
isn't it ironic all you wanna do is smoke chronic
boy, you forgot when you were down
who was around
...
