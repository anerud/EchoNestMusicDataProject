To never end and start again... the story of your life.
I know you think its right to follow this.
You're asking for a fight.

All alone...

It's what I am in asking for what's right.
Decisions aren't so hard to make

When I'm not in sight.
I'm doing the best thing for you,

And you should have the right to

Have it all at my expense.

I never held so tight.

All this control-I'm sick of being second best.
