Crack backs heavy on the cash all night
At the drug site we hung tight
Three o'clock in the night ounces of coke dirty kicks
Money gets low in the street yo
Tough times nickels thats bigger than dimes, you know the flavor
Ruff neck city ain't nothin sweet kid ain't nothin pretty

New York be poppin' the cork on crime look at the nine
Summertime in the court house oh, shit whats mine
Two to four three to nine benatoned it what
We all ran coke grams, you outta luck
Young bucks carrying gats, stay fat for what
We all slipped through the po-nig nobody bust

Freeze, we in the breeze with the blunts
Nobody drop the trees or they fronts
Meet on the roof look off the front play low
Watch out for po-po thats how it go
Three in the whip, we not lag it though, run for the gusto
Peep Marcel and Brown comin' around dippin' the logo
Run if you ever got somethin' on you son

You best a run, be off the set, bounce on the projects
Cease another vick, weed in your piss and parole gotsta have it
Slide like a rabbit move quick this is it
Hang jump from the fire escape, I made it
Drop the clip fingerprints all on it, ah fuck those bullets
