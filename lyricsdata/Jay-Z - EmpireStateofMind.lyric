Yeah
Yeah, I'm up at Brooklyn
Now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to DeNiro
But I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra
And since I made it here
I can make it anywhere
Yeah they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem
All of my Dominicanos
Right there up on Broadway
Brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot
560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen like the Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruising down 8th Street
Off-white Lexus
Driving so slow but B.K. is from Texas
Me I’m up at Bed-Stuy
Home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on billboard
And I brought my boys with me
Say what up to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga I be spiked out; I can trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I most definitely from...

In New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made, oh
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York
