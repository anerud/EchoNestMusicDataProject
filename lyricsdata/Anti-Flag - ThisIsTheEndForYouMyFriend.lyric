Seems every station on the TV
is selling something no one can be
If every page was torn from the magazine
would cash still drive the media machine?
The products, damage and pursuit are endless
identity can leave you selfless

We will not witness this anymore
This is the end for you my friend
I can't forgive, I won't forget
on and on, we sing our songs and
on and on, the wars wage on and
on and on, we sing our songs for more
for more
...
