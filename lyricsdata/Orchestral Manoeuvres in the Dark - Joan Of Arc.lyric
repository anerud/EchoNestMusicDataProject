A little Catholic girl who's fallen in love
A face on a page, a gift from above
She should have known better than to give her heart
She should have know better than to ever part

Without me
Without me

I gave her everything that I ever owned
I think she understood though she never spoke
She shouldn't oughta try to be that way
She shouldn't have to go there ever again
