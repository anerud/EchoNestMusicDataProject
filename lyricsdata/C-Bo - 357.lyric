Verse 1-(C-Bo)
My first name is Smith, my last name is Wesson,
but in yo hood I'm known as 357,
have yo neighborhood punk quick to shoot a man,
an have Clark Kent thinkin that he's superman,
wit six in the cylinders chambers, I'm the cup of curs that got ya
feelin like the ultimate banger,
but some fools misuse my abilities, doin drive-by shootin everything
they see,
I'm quick to cap it in yo life if you tempt me,
playin Russian ruelet but is the cylinder empty,
fully loaded fool, you shouldn't have been trippin,
then you wouldn't be holdin yo head in yo hands to keep yo brains from
drippin,
I'm a lethal weapon registered in everythang,
used by the police, dope dealers an yo local gang,
I'm the hardest mutha fucka alive, right in front of yo eyes, kill any
man wit the quickness now who the fuck am I?
(Chorus)
