I'm hot, you're cold
You go around like you know
Who I am, but you don't
You've got me on my toes

I'm slippin? into the lava
And I'm tryin? keep from goin' under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin? up, burnin? up for you baby
C'mon girl

I fell so fast
Can't hold myself back
High heels, red dress
All by yourself, gotta catch my breath
