First time I saw you
I was driving in my car
You smiled at me
As you drove by

Next time I saw you
I was drinking in a bar
Just trying to save the world

And right now as time goes by
And still you're stuck inside my mind
And in my pen and in my head
And in my cigarette in bed
I want you now
Please tell me how
