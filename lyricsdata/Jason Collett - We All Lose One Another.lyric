So this is the day of the dead
St. Jude and the Lady of Guadalupe
The apples and oranges
And silver coins for ghosts to gamble with

Marigolds and candles
This is birth and this is death
All in the same breath

We all lose one another along the way
We all lose one another along the way

This is the day of the dead
...
