Try to remember.
Try to forget.
Try to remember.

Look back, try to remember
That name sounds so familiar
Sue! These letters are driving me crazy
They're driving me so fucking crazy
They're making me so angry

Bradley. (To remember)
Bradley. (So Familiar)
Bradley. (To remember)
Bradley. (So Familiar)

One more year, do something
Make something from nothing
