You've got that look in your eyes
And I've got plans for two
Though you're the kinda girl
Who likes to take her time with love
I'd gladly wait forever for you

But in the middle of the night
I know something ain't right
We've got something special girl
Let's give it a try

One night of touchin'
Two nights of trust
Three nights of huggin'
Makes one night of love

One night of touchin'
Two nights of trust
Three nights of huggin'
Makes one night of love
