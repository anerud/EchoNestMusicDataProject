Hey
(Yeah)
Ehh
(What)
Hey, yeah yeah
C'mon
(C'mon)
(Here we go)

Everyday I see you
With some girlfriend, yeah
You think I could care less about it
(Care less about it)
I could keep it secret
Keep playing pretend, oh
But the way I feel you, I doubt it

No more waiting, hesitating
It's guaranteed

I'm gonna make you miss me
You're gonna wanna kiss me
I'm gonna make you miss me
All of the time

Boy, you wanna get with me
You know you can't resist me
I'm gonna make you miss me
'Til you are mine

(I say, check it out)
You're about to find out
I get what I want
Once I've made up my mind
(Made up my mind, oh)
Gonna let you see me, turning it on
That'll make you open your eyes
Your eyes

You'll be pulling, you'll be pulling
Passionately, 'cuz

I'm gonna make you miss me
(I'm gonna make you miss me)
You're gonna wanna kiss me
(Wanna kiss me)
