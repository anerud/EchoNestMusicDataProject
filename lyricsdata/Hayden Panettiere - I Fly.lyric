La La La La, La La La La
La La La La La La
La La La La, La La La La La

Six a.m.
Radio Playin'
Stumble out of bed,
Runnin' out the door
A brand new day
Never thought I'd have this feeling
Never thought I'd get this far
But I'm okay...

And I fly
I reach out my hands and touch the sky
That's right in front of me
And I try
Just let go, relax, enjoy the ride
And I feel free
When I fly
When I fly

Thinkin' back
When there were days
...
