There's been delays
Murders of emotions
Distractions in waves
Oh, stunted elevations

Huh? Can't seem to find a way out
Huh? Can't seem to find a way out
Huh? Can't seem to think for yourself
Huh? Can't seem to live without

Information age
System overload
Shoot you for the fame
Lies flow fast like forehead sutures

We've been betrayed
Now we are the hunted
...
