Bed clothes, why am I in bed clothes?
watching out the window
watching what I don't know
on the fire escape now
hands they start to shake now
ready for the rail to break now
and I'm awake at last awake

Cursing, rattling and cursing
go ahead and do your worst then
your worst that I can take

Oh let the rain fall down
and wash this world away
oh let the sky be grey
cause if its ever gonna get any better
its gotta get worse for a day
