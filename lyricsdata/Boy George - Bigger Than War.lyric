I큞l size it up if you want me to
it큦 bigger than me, the song you love,
the ones you hate, Eyeliner voodoo,
here we go again.

Bigger than you, bigger than me
love is bigger than war. (two times)

Holds us together tears us apart
make us forget and remember who we are
just like an atom it큦 here and it큦 there
