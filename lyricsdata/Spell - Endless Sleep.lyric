The night was black, rain fallin' down;
Looked for my baby, she's nowhere around.
Traced her footsteps down to the shore,
'Fraid she's gone forever more.
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
"I took your baby from you away."
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
"Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep."
