Well it's not about them
It's all about us
Can you hear it again
Or just take it on trust
Yeah you still got a way to get out of this 1-story town

So you swallow your pride
Put your heel on the gas
And you're laughing inside about kicking your ass
And you gotta stand up,
If you don't then you're just falling down

Why don't you
Turn your car around
Forget your way back home
Cos it's not me there anymore
Turn your car around
You're better off alone
I'll pick myself up off the floor
