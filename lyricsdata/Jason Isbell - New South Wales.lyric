Here we sit
Across the table from each other
A thousand miles from both our mothers,
Barely old enough to rust

Pretending both our hearts are anchors
Taking candy from these strangers
Amidst the diesel and the dust

And here we sit
Singing words nobody taught us
Drinking fire, and spitting sawdust,
Trying to teach ourselves to breathe
