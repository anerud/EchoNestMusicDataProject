How can anybody ever change
When the whole world wants you to stay the same
I guess you just take the blame
Of being someone who had to find her own way

In your dreams you're fabulous
But in your life ridiculous
See Alice had to go to Wonderland
To sip upon the tea that left her in a trance yeah

[chorus]
In Suburbia It always stays the same
How can anybody ever change
Uh oh uh oh uh
In Suburbia People never change
...
