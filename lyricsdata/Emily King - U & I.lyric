All in the spring
As the lovers and birds would sing
I'd be walkin' alone with nowhere to go
Quietly doin' my thing

Then came the sight
Of an energy shinin' so bright
As you closely walked by your eyes met with mine
Makin' me feel so alive

Oh, I have been waiting for all of this time
You, finally found you, my love has arrived
Once there was me, now there's U and I
