The cryogenic holocaust
Slows the disease
Give us all a taste of your miracle
We're thirsty for your medicine

The hate burns in our eyes
It's kill or be killed
It's in the nature of the human races' weak mind
To be exterminated by ourselves

Just stab their hearts for nothing
Your greedy soul screams in envy
Kill them all, release the anger
Weed out the weak, you don't need them
