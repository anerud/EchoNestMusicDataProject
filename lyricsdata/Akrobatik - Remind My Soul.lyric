Yeah, it's gettin' wild out here
It makes me wonder how a black man could ever raise a child out here
You know the old krumbsnatcha's in this land of decay
So why we killin' for the crumbs when there's so much to stay?
We're no longer suposed to be slaves
I bet Harriet Tubman will be turnin' in her grave
Like remind my soul

Of the time we were great before the self hate

My elders all feel the same there's no bravery
We're suposed to fight for freedom not just the end of slavery
Are we too selfish to even bless the kids with jewels
So our youth don't get played out for fools?
Will they get program how to behave?
Malcolm X must be turnin' in his grave
Like remind my soul

Of the time we were great before the self hate
The time we were great before the self hate (x3)
The time we were great
Wait, we still great, but

I met up with this dread, said "Peace, Respect"
