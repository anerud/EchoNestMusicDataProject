Had the walk of a girl
For a man he was sure handsome
He had the talk, he had the twirl
Man, boy he was sure handsome

Red and blue feeling cool believe it
Come on down, sort it out, believe in it
Towers are raised to the sky
Hopefully I? ll believe in it one day

Well, he didn? t know he had the rights here
He didn? t know he had the rights
