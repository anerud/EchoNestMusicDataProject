It's late at night,
I hear the rain outside my window pane
What I wanna do is sneak out and go to Lover's Lane,
Me and You,
But I can't take this feeling,
Unless if it's in control,
It's natural

Chorus:
Just like Romeo and Juliet
Jack and Jill were still in love forever
We're still in love,
Side by side and heart to heart
Time reveals that we're still in love forever
We're still in love
