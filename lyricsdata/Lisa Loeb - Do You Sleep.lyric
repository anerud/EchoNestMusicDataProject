Do you eat sleep do you breathe me anymore?
Do you sleep do you count sheep anymore?
Do you sleep anymore?

Do you take plight on my tongue like lead?
Do you fall gracefully into bed anymore?

I saw you as you walked across my room
You looked out the window, you looked at the moon
And you sat on the corner of my bed
And you smoked with the ghost in the back of my head

Now I don't know and I don't care
If I ever will see you again
I don't know and I don't care
If I ever will be there
