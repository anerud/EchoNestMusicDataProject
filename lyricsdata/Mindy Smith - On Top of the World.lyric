You and me sitting on top of the world.
Carefree, just a boy and a girl. '
It's likely we're both falling in love,
cause lately we just can't get enough of us.
You and me floating on top of a cloud
singing,
singing this song out loud.
Easy learning to float like this,
like it should be.
Baby, you know I can't resist.
ooooh
oooooooh
