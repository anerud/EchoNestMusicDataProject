I was in love with you
And gave my heart to you
I did my best
To keep you satisfied

You took the love from me
And used it selfishly
You did not give back
Your love to me at all

I gave the sun to you
You said it was too bright
I gave you diamond rings
You said they didn't shine

I gave my world to you
But you said it's not enough
What in the world could I have done
To make you be so rough?

'Til you do me right
I don't even wanna talk to you
I don't even wanna hear
You speak my name

And 'til you do me right
Only wrong is gonna come to you
Nothin' good is gonna come
'Til you change, change your ways
Until you change your evil ways

Girl, I was there for you
