I feel a filth in my bones
Wash off my hands till it's gone
Your walls they're closing in
With velvet curtains

Some love was made for the lights
Some kiss your cheek and goodnight
Lift up a red high heel
Lock up your doors with steel

You're making noise in my street
My blinds are drawn, I can't see
Smashed in my car window
Didn't touch the stereo
...
