From the east coast to the west coast
Gotta gotta gotta go
True sounds of a revolution
Gotta gotta gotta go
In our hearts and in our souls
Gotta gotta gotta go
United we stand devided we fall
Gotta gotta gotta go

Cant keep touch with you or me
Gotta gotta gotta go
Need sense of security
Gotta gotta gotta go
Want to live my life for me
Gotta gotta gotta go
Why cant they just let me be
Gotta gotta gotta go

Say I'm crazy
Just brain dead
Planting thoughts
