Mmh, no, no
Babe, babe
Baby, baby

I been missin' you
Baby, mmh
I been missin'
Your heavenly eyes
I was thinkin' that maybe
You'd wanna come
And play awhile
I been wantin'
To touch you, yeah
I been wantin'
To spend a little time
I been dyin' to make love
To you again
Like we did last night

So, baby, won't you
Ooh, come around my way
