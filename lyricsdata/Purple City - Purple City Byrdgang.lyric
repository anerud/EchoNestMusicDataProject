Shiest Bub:
Yo it's Shiest Bub, yeah you know I'm a veteran
10th grade I was a Varsity letterman
Introduced to crack, now we headed to Maryland
Fiends knockin' at the door, go ahead nigga let 'em in
Yeah we poppin', cop 4 keys when the cheddars in
Niggaz I ain't worryin', send shots an' they scurryin'
These actions we, hurried 'em, bastards we burried 'em
In the belly ofthe beast it's Shiest the Barbarian

Dipset that Purple City Byrdgang (We ride the 5)
Hardbody that Purple City Byrdgang (Eastside)
That's us that Purple City Byrdgang (Woop Woop)
That's us that Purple City Byrdgang (Dipset)
Dipset that Purple City Byrdgang (Eastside)
Hardbody That Purple City Byrdgang
