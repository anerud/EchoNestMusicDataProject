Something on your mind
I feel it everytime I'm with you
If what you like to do
Is something I like too, let's get it tight

If you play the cards right
Everything will be alright with me
If you play the cards right
Everything will be alright with me

You won't have to hide
What you feel inside and be afraid to talk to me
Love is guaranteed
Play them right with me and you will see

If you play the cards right
Everything will be alright with me
If you play the cards right
Everything will be alright with me

If you play the cards right
Everything will be alright with me
