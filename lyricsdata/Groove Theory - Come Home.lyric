You were born into a cold world
With only the angels on your side
And they whispered you must stay gold here
Don't let nothin' blind your eyes

So you go out into those cold streets
And you get caught up in their lies
They offer you money and power
But someday they will leave you there to die

Don't you know the street will never love you like I do
You won't find out until you're alone
The street will never love you like I do
So leave that life behind and come home
...
