It lies here slowly
It lets you know
It lingers slowly until you know
And I'm naked in your heart
I can't make it stop
I'm breaking in your heart
And I can't make it stop
I'd try and I can't make it stop
And I'd like it if you don't ever stop
In your heart, in your heart
I feel naked in your heart

I want to make you wonder
I want to make it start
