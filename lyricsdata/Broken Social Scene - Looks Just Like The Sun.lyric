Looks just like the sun
Looks just like it
Looks just like the sun
Looks just like it
But it looks just like the sun
Looks just like it
But I'm breathing, thinking one...

Heart is pounding in his chest
Reaches suddenly for his gun
Should be sailing in the west
Flower that could be his fun

(keep going)

Tree of families on his head
Weary red, split open eyes
...
