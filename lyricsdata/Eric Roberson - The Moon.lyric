To the moon… and down again…
C'mon…
I'm comin'…
C'mon girl…
I wanna go…
I wanna take you there…
To the moon, (oh yeah baby)
and down again
Alright…

Am I dreaming?
I never felt like this
Yearning for a hug
And feening for a kiss
Our time is so limited
You say you have to go
when we get intimate
I know you're scared
Cause love is risky
But you're gonna have to relax
And put your trust in me
Cause you're secure
as long as you're here
But when things get steamy
baby you cant just disappear
...
