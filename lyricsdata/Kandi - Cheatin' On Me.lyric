Oh, oh, I can't believe it

When I got home last night
Somethin' didn't seem right
I think I know what's goin' on
There's been another ho in my home

Cigarettes in the trash
He doesn't even smoke
Two glasses in the sink
The Dom is still cold
Trojans come in three
But one is gone

Hell no
Said I know what's goin' on

My man's been cheatin' on me
(My mama told me there'll be days like this)
My man's been cheatin' on me
(Oh, oh, yeah)

My man's been cheatin' on me
(My mama told me there'll be days like this)
My man's been cheatin' on me
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

How could he do this to me?
