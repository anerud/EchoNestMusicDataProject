Lord, I'm going uptown
To the Harlem River to drown
Dirty water gonna cover me over
And I'm not gonna make a sound

I'm on a roll, mama, I gotta go
Gotta get there while I still can
Troubled days are behind me now
And I know they're gonna let me in

When you see me walking up the empty yard
With a-singing and a-clapping my hands
Tell my mama I love her, tell my father I tried
Give my money to my baby to spend
