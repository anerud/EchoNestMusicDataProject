I feel drained, there's so many thoughts on my brain
And I've had enough of going round
Chasing you boy
Play myself, here's what I'm gonna do
I'll let go, take back my heart
So turn it over,
Sooner or later, you'll be sorry
Soon as you say you're sorry
It will be too late, I'll be gone
I'll be gone
