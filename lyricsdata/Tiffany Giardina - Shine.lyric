What makes a river flow?
Open the leaves of trees as they grow
It's the wings of the world that's just out of you
Wonder is all around
Raising each breeze
Each seed in the ground
If you only believe
Then the magic is true
Just like the magic in you

But you might seem small now
And dreams can seem so far
You never know your simple glow
Can light a brand new star
'Cause ever heart is a perfect part of nature's great design
