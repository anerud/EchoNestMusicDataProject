Came in from the city
Walked into the door
I turned around when I heard
The sound of footsteps on the floor
Love just like addiction
Now I'm hooked on you
I need some time to get it right
Your love's gonna see me through

Can't stop now, don't you know?
I ain't never gonna let you go
Don't go

Oh, baby, make your mind up
Give me what you got
Fix me with your lovin'
Shut the door and turn the lock
Hey, go get the doctor
Doctor came too late
Another night, I feel all right
My love for you can't wait

Can't stop now, don't you know?
I ain't never gonna let you go
