You look sweet as ever
Just how I picture you
Swear that you're looking better
And thats so hard to do
Girl I hope you don't mind
If I remininsce all the time
When I was your guy and you were my girl
There was nobody else in my world

Let's get the mood right
Turn on your heart light
Put on that old red dress
Baby let's cruise
Baby it's your night
Blow out the candlelight
We're going out tonight
Just me and you
