Blaze rage red is the color of youth
Be careful what you do
Another dead, color bled, blue is new
Be careful what you choose

Little white lies, trouble hides the truth
Bury your excuse
Every bird sings when they're envy green
It's time to come clean

Fallin' like a stone again
Dive in, deeper down you go

Take me all the way to the end
Show me how you want it to end
