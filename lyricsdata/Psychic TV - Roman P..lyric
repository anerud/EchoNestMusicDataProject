Roman you are, Roman you be
Roman in your history
Roman in your victory
Roman in your destiny

[Chorus:]
Are you free, are you really free?
Are you really, really, really, really, really free?
Is it you or is it me?
Or is it simply history?
Are you free, are you really free?
Are you really, really, really, really, really free?
Is it you or is it me?
