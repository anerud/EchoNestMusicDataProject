Take my hand, touch my face
Let me feel your embrace
Let me see in your eyes
That you won't say goodbye
Just tell me how you feel
I don't know what you're thinking anymore

And if you need me, you'd kiss me
Then tell me how you feel
And if you want me, you'd show me
That your love is for real
And if you love me
You'd hold me in your arms where I belong
So while I'm feeling strong
I sing you one last song

Let me ask time has passed
