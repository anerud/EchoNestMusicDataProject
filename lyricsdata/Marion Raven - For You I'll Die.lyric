You said I'm yours to keep
With your voice so deep
You were just talking in your sleep

I do just what you'll crave
My life with you I'll wait
All I get is a spot next to your grave

And you're a fool to not see
I'm not hanging here to keep you company
But what am I supposed to do
When all hope is gone
How am I supposed to leave you when you're the only one
Made a deal with mister hades
My soul he wants to buy
For you I'll die
...
