Be yourself and live a little
Don't bother painting your face
Tomorrow it may rain and colors run
Better it quench the flowers thirst

Don't be afraid to live a little
Don't be afraid of the people that belittle our love
Oh, our love, oh our love

Open up your thoughts and listen to others
Your fellow man may surprise you
