Well I can't stand to look at you now
This revelation's out of my hands
Still I can't bear the thought of you now
This complication's leaving me scared

Stay when you think you want me
Pray when you need advice
Hey keep your sickness off me tryin to get through
Blame all your weakness on me
Shame that I'm so contrite
Hey keep your fingers off me why can't I get through?

You think you have the best of intentions
