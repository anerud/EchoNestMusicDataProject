Oh no
Don't go changing
That's what you told me from the start
Thought you were something different
That's when it all just fell apart
Like you're so perfect
And I can't measure up
Well I'm not perfect
Just all messed up

I was losing myself to somebody else
But now I see
I don't wanna pretend
So this is the end of you and me
'Cause the girl that you want
She was tearing us apart
'Cause she's everything
Everything I'm not

It's not like I need somebody
