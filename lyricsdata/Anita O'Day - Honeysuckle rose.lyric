Every honey bee fills with jealousy
When they see you out with me
I don't blame them goodness knows
My honeysuckle rose
Flowers droop and sigh
When you're passing by
And I know the reason why
You're much sweeter goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose
I don't buy sugar you just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar it's so sweet when you stir it up
