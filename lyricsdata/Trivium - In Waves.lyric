In waves
In waves
In waves
In waves

Do I end this all for the world to see?
In waves, in waves
Do I take everybody else down
Everybody else down with me?

In waves
In waves
In waves

Do I end this all for the world to see?
In waves, in waves
Do I take everybody else down
Everybody else down with me?

I know that death approaches fast
