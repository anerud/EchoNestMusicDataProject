See I've been watching you for a while your smile and stuff
And I don't know if I can be with you for tonight, alright
Is that alright, baby, baby

There is only one for me
You have made that a possibility
We could take that step to see
If this is really gonna be
All you gotta do is say yes

All you gotta do is say yes
Don't deny what you feel let me undress you, babe
Open up your mind and just rest
I'm about to let you know you make me so

All you gotta do is say yes
