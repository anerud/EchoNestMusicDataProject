Yesterday, was not just another day
Not like before
Yesterday, I saw your smiling face
Love walked through my door
One precious moment changed my life
One tender kiss made everything right
One touch from you and this world was mine
It was in your arms where I found forever
Cried my first tears of joy, last night
Heaven shined a light
All my dreams came true
My first night with you
