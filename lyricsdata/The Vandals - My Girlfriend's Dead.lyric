I once had a girlfriend
but then one day she dumped me
and everywhere I'd go people would ask me
where she was.
I don't wanna talk about her
someone always asks about her
so I tell them all
"My girlfriend's dead"

I say it's lukemia
or sometimes bulimia
Or a great big truck ran her over
and chopped off her head

I don't wanna talk about her
someone always asks about her
so I tell them all
"she's dead!"
