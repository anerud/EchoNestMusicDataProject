Who shot him in the back, peacetime
Who took him by surprise, tippy toes
You can't bury that door 3 times, hide my eyes 4 times

I'm gonna sink my teeth into Kansas, Kansas, Kansas, Kansas
Kansas, Kansas, Kansas, Kansas

I reach a higher plain when I speak so slow and hardly breath
They're gonna run out of shapes when they fetch my family
I, I must confess I'm gonna see that man again
