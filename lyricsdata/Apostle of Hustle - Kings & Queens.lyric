see I've gotten everything
complete for you
turn that part way
it's with it I found you
here there's pillaging
here I cart her arms
she takes a little box
next right to the starlight
little kings and queens
little kings and queens

funny geese going by
they go through space to rule the sky
blood is flowed
comets soar
...
