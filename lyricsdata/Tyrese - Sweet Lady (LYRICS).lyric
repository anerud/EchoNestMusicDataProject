Ohhhhhh
Can you babe
Be my sweet lady
I want you to be my lady

Sweet Lady would you be my sweet love for a lifetime?
I'll be there when you need me
Just call and recieve me

Now any other day I would play it cool
But i can't now cause i want you
You see i'm hooked on how you flex your style
And i wanna talk for a little while
i've never really seen your type
But I must admit that i kinda like
So maybe if you have the time we can talk about
You being mine baby

Sweet Lady would you be my sweet love for a lifetime?
I'll be there when you need me
Just call and recieve me
