Everybody go, the party's over
I want to be alone in my head, in my bed tonight
You never show
You must really love her
You think I don't know but I do, yeah it's true
I think over is over
I'm right back where I started when it comes to wanting you
I can't have what I wanted

But I did, I can, I was, I am only human, living, dying
Just like any fool who ever breathed
If love is blind, if love's a drug, it always is, it always was
...
