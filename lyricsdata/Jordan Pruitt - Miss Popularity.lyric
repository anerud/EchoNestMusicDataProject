She's a walking casting call
A fashion runway doll
Her 4.0 comes naturally

She's good at everything
She's got a following
And an entourage of copy queens

No need to try out for the school play
You know she'll get the lead anyway

She's the girl that you love to hate
She's a heart stopping double take
Everyone knows that she's got it made
Working hard to be
Miss Popularity
