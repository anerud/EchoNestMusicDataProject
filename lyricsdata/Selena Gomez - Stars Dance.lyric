Wake up to your dreams
And watch them come true
I'll make you whisper my name, I'll never leave the room
Night and day, I'll be your muse
No other girl can make you feel the way I do

I can make the stars dance
Light up the moon,
I can make the stars dance
If you want me to
The sky is everywhere,
So meet me under there
I can make the stars dance, dance, dance with you

Don't be afraid, close your eyes
...
