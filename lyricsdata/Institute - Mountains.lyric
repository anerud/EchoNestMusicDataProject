Gonna ride out on a speedboat
Gonna ride out on the radio
Gonna fix mine where possible
Gonna find myself a phone

We're so flammable
We go, we go, we glow

Mountains
Reach so close to the sun
One love
Takes you back where you become
Over mountains

Gotta get free like a fat wave
Gotta get free from the circus
There spaces for acrobats
But the jugglers are done
...
