(chorus)
It's your life, don't be stupid though (4x)
'cause when you waste it

(Black C)
Livin that young life
Where nothin nice runnin from the vice
Think twice you lose your life gamblin with the dice
'cause it ain't nothin but a ninety thing baby
And all the hoes in the Point drive me crazy
Can't fade me
If they had a ten-foot pole
I stroll down the block givin props
To my niggaz on the spot
It won't stop and it won't quit
'cause the hoes can't f**k with our shit I switch
Up on that ass, fast
If she try to fade a young nigga she'll get mashed, bitch
It's just a juice thang, mothaf**kin deuce thang
