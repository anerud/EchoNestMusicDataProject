You don't want to talk about it
'cause you know that there's nothing to say

Your policies are fucked so we're going away
We say that it's wrong, wrong, wrong
You say that it's alright
You won't have to look at us after tonight

Take your nightclub and shove it up your ass
I don't want your discount pass

Uptight
