Baby, baby, why can't you sit still?
Who killed that bird out on you window sill?
Are you the reason that he broke his back?
Tell me, did I see, you think I'd laugh about that?

If I come on like a dream?
Will you let me show you what I mean?
Will you let me come on inside?
Will you let it glide?

Can I have some remedy?
Remedy for me, please
If I'd some remedy
I'd take enough to please me
