You got me runnin' baby
You give me somethin' way beyond revenue
You put the magic in me
I feel the magic when we do what we do
And oh
I can't do without you for too long
You're my situation
You're my kinda lover

You keep me all together
You take me out whenever I'm lettin' down
You got the motions baby
