I saw you there, so beautiful
You stopped and stared, so magical
Then you asked me for my name
And we took an uptown train
Before you leave, get up to go
I wanna know

Do you like Shakespeare, Jeff Buckely
Watching movies on Sunday?
Do you like kissing when it's raining
Making faces in the station?
Do you like, I need to know
What do you like, before you go?

You walk me home, so wonderful
It starts to snow, it's incredible
