You wanna know more, more, more about me
I'm the girl who's kickin' the coke machine
I'm the one that's honkin' at you cause I left late again

Hey, Hey, Hey
Can't you see I want you
By the way I push you away
Yeah, don't judge me tomorrow by the way I'm actin' today
Mix the words up with the actions
Do it all for your reaction, yeah
Hey, hey, get tangled up in me

You wanna know more, more, more, about me
Gotta know reverse psychology
