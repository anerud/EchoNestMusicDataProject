Girl, I just know I love ya now.

Flowers and beads are one thing,
But having a girl is something.
That's if you got a girl who loves you,
And thinks the whole wide world of you.

Flowers and beads are one thing,
But having you girl that's something.
That's 'cause I know you love me only,
And that you'll never leave my hear lonely.

Girl, he just knows he loves you now.
You're all I talk about and ev'rything I say and,
