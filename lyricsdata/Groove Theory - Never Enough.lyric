Boy, in my mind, I see you holdin' me
It's the one, place that you got the time
To give me some love, and it feels so fine
I don't wanna wake up, from my dreamin'
Words, that you say
Don't mean, don't mean a thing
If you can't, start showing me today
That you're gonna try, and I just can't stay
With you by my side
Cause you're not giving enough
Chorus:
Never enough, never enough
You're not giving me love
