Old 97's - "Dance with Me"

Underneath the foreign stars
In a foreign place
Where they don't love you
I do turn
In the pale moonlight
Your eyes are wide
And the band plays
Everybody wants you

And he takes your hand, tenderly
And he whispers sweet surrender
Nothing, is how he feels about girls like you
With your flip flop smiles
And your big blue eyes on vacation

Dance with me into the ocean
...
