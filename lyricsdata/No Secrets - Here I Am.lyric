Ever since I was a little girl
Ever since I took my first step
And said my first hello
I've been dancing
I've been singing
I've been hopin'
I've been dreamin'
I've been waiting
For a chance to show


Show the world
That I can be
Just like the girls on TV


Here I am
Here I am
Here I am
Isn't it crazy?
Isn't it wild?
Here I am
