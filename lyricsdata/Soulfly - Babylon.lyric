Lightning and thunder
Fear and wonder
Murder and murder
Chaos, disorder
Hate and pain
Will rise again
Nothing remains
Bring it on again...

On and on and on and on...
On and on and on and on...
Inna babylon

Hell on earth
Like a curse
War is hell
Time will tell
Apocalypse meets
The final disease
...
