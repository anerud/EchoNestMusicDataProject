We get torn apart all our lives
Told that we're useless or gifted, loved or despised
Too many generations passed and passing and passing
But all their progress lost its meaning

We call it evolution, you call it a crime
But as we run from your culture, you're running out of time
Self immolation just to keep you warm tonight
How far could this world go to reject you?
