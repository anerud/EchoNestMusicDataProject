Chemical warfare, a new dawn of terror
An insidious fester for mankind
Evoking sinister plans of destruction
Gather the fallen, upraise the counter attack

Cascades of fire burns all in sight
Human bodies burst in the heat
Collapsing in flames eaten alive
Covered in the chemical burning salvation
...
