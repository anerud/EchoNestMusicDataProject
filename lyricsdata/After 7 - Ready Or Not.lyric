I'll give you the sun, the rain, the moon, the stars and the mountains
I'll give you the world and all that you wish for
And even more girl, I love you more than you could know
And that's for sure

I'd climb the highest hill, cross the widest sea
Nothin' could discourage me
And I pray that you'll be always there for me
Forevermore

Ready or not
I'll give you everything and more
All that I've got, it's yours
I'll give you everything
All that you're looking for

I'll give you my heart, my soul, my time my love is a fountain
I will be your earth and all that you need for and even more
'Cause girl I love you more than words can show
...
