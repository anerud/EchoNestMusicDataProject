Not a day goes by I don't think about you
You left your mark on me, it's permanent, a tattoo
Pierce the skin and the blood runs through
Oh my baby

The way you move, it's right in time
The way you move, it's right in time
It's right in time with me

I stand over the stove in the kitchen
Watch the water boil and I listen
Turn off the television
