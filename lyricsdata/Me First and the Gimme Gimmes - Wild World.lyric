Now that i've lost everthing to you
you say you want to start something new
and it's breaking my heart that your leaving
baby i'm grieving
but if you wanna leave take good care
i hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
but than a lot of nice things turn bad out there

oo baby baby it's a wild world
it's hard to get by just upon a smile girl
oo baby baby it's a wild world
i'll always remember you just like a child girl
