From the world to the dreaming fields of light, yeah from the soaking mud
Gonna fly up to the sky to the scarlet thing in you
On the red wings I will sail at night to the scarlet thing in you
On a long lost ocean wave of light, submerged and unafraid

I saw you, you were one
I saw you, you were one
I saw you, you were one
I saw you, you were one

No way back to recall the way, 'cause I threw out all the why's
...
