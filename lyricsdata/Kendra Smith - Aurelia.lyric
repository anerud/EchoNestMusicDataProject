She steps over shadows the path by the castle
Gold earrings and hair and the moon
Dress like a sail it is billowing past her
She's gone down to the wishing well
Ships made of copper pennies and silver
Have sailed just like wishes away
The flowers that float past her face in the water
Will wither and soon fade away
...
