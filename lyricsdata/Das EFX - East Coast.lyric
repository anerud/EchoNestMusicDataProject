"Now I'm gonna show you how the East Coast rocks" ---> KRS-One
"Baby, baby, baby, baby, clap to this"
"It's like that y'all, you don't stop"
*repeat x2*
"Now I'm gonna show you how the East Coast rocks"
"MC's are jumpin out of shoes and socks"

Verse One: Dray, Books

Higgity-hey hun, check out the way I friggity-freak the track, umm
I diggity-do-ray-me-fah-so look at me me go like that, umm
wit the Books, iggity-oops, I get more poopcrocks for jingle
I giggity-gots the rhymes like Ronald Reagan got the wrinkles
Check the real wild, my ill style gets worked out like Bundy
I piggity-pack the skits, so save the shit, for Peggy Bundy*
Yes it's I, the yippity zippity bad boy with papers
I higgity-hump and rump cos I'm rough like sandpaper
So pucker up and whistle, I blast just like a pistol
and sharp like a thumbtack and kick like ninjitsu
I sling raps for hand claps and toe taps, I'm bound, silly creep
I leave a rapper with a single bound
Yes I rips up the West, I'm the best, I'm no jokin
I run up shit creek and freak the backstroke
So Books freak it, provide the funk alligator
Yo I'm out but "I'LL BE BACK" like Schwarzenegger

Wiggity-wait a minute, giggity-guess who, well it's, umm, me
The bumble B boogity woogity book the loopy
double O-K-iggity S, I'm slick
I giggity-got more stiggity-styles than Moby got Dick
