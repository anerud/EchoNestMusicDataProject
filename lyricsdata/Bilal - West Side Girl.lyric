Hey, how you doing 
I’ve been watching you, getting down 
From the way you’re moving 
You look like you’re from the west side part of town, girl 
You ain’t gotta talk or lick, body talk a lot of shit 
Got one question 
Could you roll with a kid like me 
I could take you where you wanna go 
We where the wind blows 
Got one question 
Could you roll with a kid like me
