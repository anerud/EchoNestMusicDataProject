Being with you
they call me the fool

They just don't know what love can do

They talk as if I'm just a baby.
They said I'd be used
lost and confused

They'll never see you the way that I do

And I'll go along with all that you want me to.

I just can't wait to see you

I only need to hold you in my arms

I just can't wait to see you

and everything will be all right.
