Oh I have been wondering where I have been pondering
Where I've been lately is no concern of yours
Who's been touching my skin
Who have I been letting
Shy and tired-eyed am I to day

I'm wounded by dust
All I have been wondering where I have been pondering
Where I've been lately is no concern of yours
Who's been touching my skin
Who have I been letting
Shy and tired-eyed am I today

Sometimes I sit, sometimes I stare
