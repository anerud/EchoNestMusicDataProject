I'm a man on fire
Walking through your street
With one guitar
and two dancing feet
Only one desire
That's left in me
I want the whole damn world to come dance with me

Oh, mhm. come dance with me.
Over murder and pain come and set you free
Over heartache and shame,
i wanna see your bodies burning like old big sun
I wanna know what we've been learning and learning from
