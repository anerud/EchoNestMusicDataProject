I feel so good I feel so numb, yeah

Yeah! Mud bath, acrobat, a midnight drive
Everybody's slippin', everybody survive
Radio talk show try to project
Everything you need when you gotta connect

Come on, come on, come on, you feel it
Come on, come on, come on, you see it
Come on, come on, come on, you wanna make it all right

Come on, come on, come on, you feel it
Come on, come on, come on, you see it
Come on, come on, come on, you wanna make it all right

Blacken the sun! What have I done?
I feel so bad I feel so numb yeah!
Blacken the sun! What have I done?
I feel so good I feel so numb yeah!
