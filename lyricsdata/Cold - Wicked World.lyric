There's blood on the gun
That's in your hand
And the murder in front of you
Send out the wolves, the king is dead
Little pills taking over

This means war
Did the sun just burn out
Leaving you all alone?

Living in a wicked world
Living in a wicked world
There's no way you will escape
No one ever gets away
