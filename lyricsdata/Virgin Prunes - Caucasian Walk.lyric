I looked at my watch and I saw I had no time
Didn't notice all the clocks on television
Controlled violence on sale in new streets
Don't delay in boring studios!
Whatever happened to Emancipation Act '73?
I think it's lost, yes it's lost
In a world of satisfaction. No delay!

Like a crazy singer in a band that's lost the words
Like a crazy singer in a band that's lost the words
Like a crazy singer in a band that's lost the words
Like a crazy singer in a band that's lost the words
Caucasian walk, Caucasian talk
Because I can't do nothing, can't do nothing

Seen is only truth in a shell of lies
Distributed feelings to a race that doesn't comprehend
I don't smoke, I just do it for the company
Political problems, sexual frustration won't end
It's the type of poison that doesn't count in life
