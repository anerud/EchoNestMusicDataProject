There's still a million things I wish I'd never said
And I know that it's never sacred
But the fear the shadowed yesterday still haunts me to the core
And I wish I'd had the state of mind to brace for so much more
But that's just me

God help me strip away what's come between the two of us
And maybe we can stay friends forever
Because you know me inside out
And it breaks my heart to pass without a word
