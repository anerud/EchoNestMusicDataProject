Behold your highness the Luniz are here
Bring them in
Man where the f**k we at who the f**k are you?
It is I Jesus Shock Jesus
And what brings you brothers to such an early fate?
Man no what the f**k man
Niggaz just shot me man what the f**k man
How dare you use such language in the face of the almighty
F**k you
You shall perish (beitch!)
It is my judgement that you shall burn in hell
Man noo
for eternity
Nooo (the Luniz are here)
Ahhh

5150, feel me
Psycho disco just go Luni
5150, feel me
Psycho disco just go Luni

I wish I had cot (what?) I wish I had some cot (why?)
So I could sky and have a place to lay my head and plot
A broke nigga boney
Quick to lick but I could never steal shit from my homies
I play acts and make scratch from table scraps
and always end up f**ked watchin other niggaz backs
I broke hamps wit my folks and get pounds
but in the mist of funk
