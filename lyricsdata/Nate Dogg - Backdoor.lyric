[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
When your days get lonely (days get lonely)
When your nights get cold (nights get cold)
When the rain starts pouring (rains starts pouring)
When your man aint home (man aint home)
You can call me baby (call me baby)
You can let me know (let me know)
You aint had none lately (had none lately)
Lemme in your backdoor (let me in your backdoor)

[Verse 1]
Meanie walks out the door
