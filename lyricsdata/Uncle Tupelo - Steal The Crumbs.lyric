Sidetracked down the middle
Never saw it coming but what a surprise
It's been a wonder

Electricity tells a story
It's a sound getting near as fear is watching you
It's watching you close

You can fight it, both arms swinging
Or try to wash it away
Or pay up to the echoes of "okay"

No more, no more will I see you
...
