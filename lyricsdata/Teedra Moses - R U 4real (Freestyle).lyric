Lately, I can't seem to get my mind off you boy
(wondering where you are, wishing 4 your call)
Thinking, All the slick ish I'm gon say when you call
to make you want IT more
(i know you want it now, but you gon want me more)
Cuz I be acting like I'm not
When I'm really feeling you
You can just relax your mind
'Cause there's so many things I wanna Do to you, Do to you
'Cause IIII, I just wanna make sure you're sure, boy
(are u sure?)
