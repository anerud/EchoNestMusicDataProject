I don't like you
I don't like your town
I don't wanna like you
I'll shop around

I don't want you
I don't want your town
I don't wanna want you
I'll shop around
I'll shop around

I can get a train
I don't need no hamburgers
No take-away
I want my own game
No bake and take
No Strawberry milkshake

I wanna picnic
I'm, sick - sick of seeing signs to eat
Walking down these dark lonely streets

I don't know you
I don't know your town
...
