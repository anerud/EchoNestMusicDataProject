(And all around the world)
(And all around the world)

(And all around the world) All around the world, same song
(And all around the world) All all around the world same song
Yo, we've been all around the world
(And all around the world) All around the world same song
(And all around the world) All all around the world same song

(same song ...)

[Shock G]
I came for the party to get naughty, get my rocks on
Eat popcorn, watch you move your body to the pop song
That I'm singing, dinga-linging
Funky beats ringin', everybody's swingin'
In the place as I kick the J A Z Z Y style
R&B mixing it with the hip hop swing beat
Champagne in my hand, it wont be long
Till I'm gone - It's just the same old song

[Humpty Hump]
It's just a freestyle, meanwhile we keep the beat kickin
Sweat drippin, girlies in the limo eatin chicken
Oops don't get the grease on your pantyhose
I love ya Rover, move over, I gotta blow my nose
Sneezin, but still I'm pleasin to all the slimmies
Pull out my jimmie, time to get busy wit a Jenny
If it's good and plenty, don't you know
There I go, there I go, there I go
But I don't go nowhere without my jim hat (jim jat)
When I'm rappin, as if she's clappin, then I'm strappin', 'cause I'm smarter than that
Then, girlie, maybe we can get along
Cutie after cutie, it's just the same old song
