Came into this world empty handed
Looking for love, just trying to keep out of the cold
I hoped a little, told a little too much
Shake my way, bending the rules till they broke

I had to run, couldn't stop
You had to know
You gotta keep it for your own
You gotta keep it for your own
You gotta keep it for your own
You gotta keep it for your own

But you were always living in my mind
I couldn't shake ya, baby you're taking your time
