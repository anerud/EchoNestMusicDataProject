I miss you
I'm talking to you baby
I miss you

I miss you
I'm talking to you baby
I miss you

We used to talk,
And laugh all night girl
What happened to those days?
Did they all just fade away
Holding you in my arms
Made me feel so happy
Then you said you had to go
What's wrong, baby, I need to know

But now it's a dream
(Now it's a dream)
That I wish you could come
Back and make come true
(Come back to make come true)
But you're long gone away
(Come on back baby)
But now I'm missing you
(I miss you, yes I do,
from the bottom of my heart)

I miss you (oh yes I do)
I'm talking to you, baby
(hear me when I say)
I miss you (I miss you yes I do, yes I do)
I miss you (oh)
I'm talking to you, baby
(I'm talking to you)
I miss you (only to you, baby)
