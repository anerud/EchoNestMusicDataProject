Freddie Mercury
Miscellaneous
Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow
You had to kill the conversation
You always had the upper hand
Got caught in love and stepped in sinking sand
You had to go and ruin all our plans
Packed your bags and you're leaving home
Got a one-way ticket and you're all set to go
But we have one more day together, so

Love me like there's no tomorrow
Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it
