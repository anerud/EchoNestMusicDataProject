She lived like she knew nothing lasts
Didn't care to look lika anyone else
And she was beautiful, so beautiful
I still hear her laugh like she's here

Shower it down on all the young
It isn't so wrong to have such fun

Forever angel
I hope they love you like we do
Forever angel
I'll be proud to be like you
Be like you
(I'll be proud to be like you)
