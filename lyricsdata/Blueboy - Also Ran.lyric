Last night I thought I found you
I saw it in a dream
I was tangled in the rushes, baby
You were caught up in the stream
The more I tried to reach you
The more you slipped away
And when I woke up in the darkness
I was calling out your name
You and I we dance around it
Why is the truth so hard to say?
We long for true love, well
We've found it, it's just one belief away
