Not Your Friend by Case
Your girlfriend wants to get with me
I can tell how she looks at me
And how she licks her tongue at me
Then ask for a ride home from me
She likes what I do to you
Tell you all the things that you never knew
Like the sky and her Ferrari's blue
Spending time in Honolulu

Bridge
I told you once before
About that girl
She's so mysterious
So watch that girl
And keep that girl
Away from me
