In this life, I breathe for you and me, for ourselves.
We tire endlessly in the way of when we disagree.
End the day again…and I feel the disheartening,
but I still go on in a destructive vow.
For you, it takes so long just to take back things you didn't mean…
and I will do the same…and it seems too late now.
It seems to be so innocent, just like a dream.
