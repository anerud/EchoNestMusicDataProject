Outside the rain begins and it may never end
so cry no more on the shore a dream
will take us out to sea
forever more forever more
close your eyes and dream
and and you can be with me
'neath the waves through the caves of hours
long forgotten now
we're all alone we're all alone
Close the window calm the light
and it will be alright
...
