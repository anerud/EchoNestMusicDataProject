(feat. T.M.F.)

[Intro: Ghostface, (Big Trife)]
Yo, yeah {"New Ghostface!"}
Yeah, to glorious days {"one"}
Yeah God, check it out y'all
We back, yes yes y'all {"one"}
(Fake roller derbies)
Yeah, masked avengers
We're here to sharpen your sword {"one"}
All praises due to T.M.F., Wu-Tang Clan
Scream on it, Ghost

[Ghostface]
Aiyyo, we at the weedgate, waitin for Jake
We want eight ravioli bags, two thirsty villians yelling bellyaches {"one"}
Heavyweight rhyme writers hittin the grass
Stash the right bitch, pull out his kite from this white bitch {"one"}
Talkin bout, "Dear Ghost, you the only nigga I know
like when the cops come, you never hide your toast" {"one"}
Guests started mashing, CVL, Ice Water battlion
Past tense place to gold caskets {"one"}
Dru Hill bitches, specialist loungin at the mosk
Suede cufy, Rabbi come dig up a dentist {"one"}
Rhymes is made of garlic, never in the target
when the NARC's hit, rumor is you might start to spit {"one"}
You nice Lord, sweet daddy Grace, wind lifted
on the dancefloor, mangos is free followed by Ghost {"one"}
Dug behind monument cakes, we never half-baked
Alaskan, cess-capade, pushin new court dates {"one"}
Trauma, hands is like candy canes, lay my balls on ice
