I come home in the middle of the night
I get my bags inside and I'm bein' real quiet, Mama
Walk in the door and I turn on the lights, I find you
Flat on your back with your legs open wide

Move on over, Mama I'm comin' home
Woman, you been sleepin' in the middle of the bed too long

Got the dishes on the counter, got the clothes on the floor
Mama, week's worth of trash sittin' there by the door
