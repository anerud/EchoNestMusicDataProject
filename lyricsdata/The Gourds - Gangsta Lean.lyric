Yer gonna have t'sit there and drink yer cup of muddy water
Yer gonna have t'let the blood dry on yer hands
Ask yer mama t'knit you a blanket from esau's thigh
Cause yer gonna have t'learn t'be lowly and wise
And you can't tell me it sits alright with you
Gangsta lean gansta lean you done killed them all
Gangsta lean gangsta lean you done killed them
