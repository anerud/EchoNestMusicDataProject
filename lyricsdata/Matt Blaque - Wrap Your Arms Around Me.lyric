I concede that you were right about this place
I can make a perfect likeness of your body if I trace
I can hold you 'til you turn out the light
And I can't see

Do you believe we are all innately good
Do you think that you would love me 'til tomorrow if you could
Would you please turn down the radio
So we can speak
