Take these plastic people
Read their lips, now let it linger
Is there anything that makes them sound sincere?
Come on, tightly hold your hand
Take a deep breath
Give them the finger
Are you worried that your thoughts are not quite clear?
Twitch
Overlooked, unfit appearance

I remember falling
I remember marching
Like a one man army
Through the blaze
I know I'm coughing
I believe in something
I don't want to remember falling
For your lies
