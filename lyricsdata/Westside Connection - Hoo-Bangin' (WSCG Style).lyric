(Intro:)
(Ice Cube)
(Westsiiiiide!)
Hoo-Bangin' on the transformers
These trick-ass niggas quick to tuck they tail
But fuck that... you know how we git...

(Can't get enough of this gangsta shit!)

(Ice Cube)
It's the don go let'em know
Unwettable, ahh. big fish incredible
Hoo-Bangin' on the white collars got a pile of dollars
Still rollin' Impalas
I'm bombin' on Common Sense
Chicago is mine nigga hit the fence
Intense kingpin nigga worldwide
And I bring sin when I wanna hoo-ride
Who died and who applied the pressure
Show me 3 niggas that's fresher
Westside Connect Gang oh yeah we talkin' shit
Nigga do you know who you fuckin' wit?

(Ice Cube)
Ice Cube is the lick Westside is the click
(Can't get enough of this gangsta shit!)(2X)

(Mack 10)
It's Mack 10 fool that nigga with heaters
Gauges revolvers techs and millimeters
You know how we hoo-ride when we collide
Niggas run but they can't hide
Cause its world wide (Inglewooooooooooood!)
I'm jackin' and lickin niggas thats straight trippin'
Square ass niggas can't tell a ounce from a chicken
I fill you full of lead and I take you Big heads
So nigga watch how ya talkin' I'm still chicken hawkin
So hit the deck punk don't move my tech is bigger
And you'll be dead if I pull this trigger
