Detroit, Motown
They gave us a soup bowl this year
And you know what happened?
Robbing, shooting, killing
Murder (Eminem: Murder, murdeeeerrrr)
Robbing, shooting, killing
Murder (Eminem: Murder, murdeeeerrrr)
Hennyed up, remied up
ski mask, black truck
Dickie outfit,
passenger side (Mr. Grip Pump)
Fuck it I just did two lines
A chrome tech nine
, it'll tear out nigga's spine
...
