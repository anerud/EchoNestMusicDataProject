Human flesh at my disposal, sacrificed for my amusement*
Deranged obsession with fire, my victims I will immolate
Their languished bodies hooked and dragged to the pyres
I receive much delight torching my captives
Smothering them in homemade napalm
I set them ablaze, shackled to stakes, I laugh as they writhe
While molten skin slides off their bodies
My paradise of blackened death
Corpses burnt to a crisp as far as the eye can see
...
