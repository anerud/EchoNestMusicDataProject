living in fear
living in fear
living in fear
heartquakes

don't lift a finger for fear you'll offend
you can't tell your conscience from an instinct or a trend
last year's neuroses are now all the rage
your aberrations could be earning you a wage
take em to the stage
constant anxiety panic is near
living in fear

rampant paranoia
everyone's a victim
god's become a lawyer
everything's addicting

heartquakes
living in fear
living in fear
...
