Oooh .aaww lalala ladada.lada da laalaa

[Verse 1:]
Can't get you off of my mind. I thought somebody new and some time would do.
but still I can't seem to let you go. now I'm with somebody else and he loves me so.
(Hell give anything.) he'll do anything . just to let me know I'm his one.
so do I stay where I'm at. do I try to get back with the one I trully love.
