[Verse 1]
Listen
How do I live without you [echo]
And every day that I open my eyes and turn to my side
Gotta smile deep inside
Cause the one who was there was you
And how do I focus at work [echo]
Everytime my cell phone rings or a pager beeps
I'm so nervous so anxious but hoping the caller is you
And how am I s'pose to get sleep [echo]
When every night that I lay down my head in my bed
you ain't there with your arms wrapped around me holding me all nite through
And how could this be fair [echo]
When I gave you all of my love all my time every dime after spending still
you could walk out the door to explore

[Chorus]
Another relationship
Is that what this is about
Another relationship
That you would leave your own house
For Another relationship
Was that the straw that broke the camels back
Another relationship another relationship
Baby tell me whats up with that

What does she have on me
What does she do that is so damn good that would make you give up
all the love all the trust and the stuff that you built with me
