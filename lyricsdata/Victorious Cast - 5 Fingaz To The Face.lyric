You know I flaunt cha, cuz girl I really want cha
And you lookin' nice, got me cooler than a bag of ice
Now freeze, freeze, freeze, now go
Drop it fast and move it real slow, oh!
What?!

You smell so fruity
I'm a pirate and you're my booty (arg)
So move it in close
And let me have my daily dose (uhhh)

Girl, I've been thinkin' about you, thinkin' about me,
Whatcha think about it?
