pathetic sympathies
left for the bloody at heart
everything fades to shit
everything tears me apart
caustic insecurities
surface above the withheld
every time I need
everything I want
aesthetic disguises
underlying doubts
my direction dies

every things right up in your face
everyone's right up in front
push me against the wall
