[[spoken:]] Stand and deliver!

I'm the dandy highwayman
Whom you're too scared to mention
I spend my cash
On looking flash
And grabbing your attention
The devil take your stereo
And your record collection
The way you look, you'll qualify
For next year's old age pension!

Stand and deliver
Your money or your life
Hoh!

Try to use a mirror
Not a bullet or a knife
Hoh!

I'm the dandy highwayman
So sick of easy fashion
The clumsy boots, peekaboo roots
...
