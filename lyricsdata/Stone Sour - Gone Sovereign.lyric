No ones laughing now
No ones laughing now
I'm sullen and sated
And you can't put a price on me

I won't share this disarray
I won't pull these hands away
I need to be chosen and my god, and my God don't pray for me!

So scatter all my ashes when I'm dead
And shatter every legend in my head
If only the committed will survive
Is anybody here still left alive!?
