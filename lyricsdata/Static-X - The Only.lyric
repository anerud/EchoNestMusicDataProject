I'm winning, you're losing
I'm falling, your agony
Lower than lower before
Your forgotten memory

My heaven, your hell
I'm killing, your fantasy
More and more, you follow
Your divorced reality

You're trying to take me
You're trying to make me
This is the only
Give me the only thing
I'm tired of trying
...
