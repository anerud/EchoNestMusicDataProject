I must have rehearsed my lines a thousand times
Until I had them memorized
But when I get up the nerve to tell you
The words that never seem to come out right, ohh

If only you knew how much I do
Do love you, oh
If only you knew, how much I do
Do need you

I dream of moments we share, but your not there
I'm living in a fantasy, but you don't even suspect
...
