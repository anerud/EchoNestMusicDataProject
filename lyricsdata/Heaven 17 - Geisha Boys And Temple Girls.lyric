Look ahead, on the screen,
Slim perfect creatures and they're just 16
Their eyes meet, this is it,
The contact so much more than words can transmit
He stands up, she gives in,
Their first encounter, their embrace within
A short ride, they arrive,
There is no doubt that true love will survive

We are the geisha boys
Doing it wrong again
They are the chosen ones
Doing it right
Here come the temple girls
Looking for sanctuary
Naked as advertised
For the first time

If you turn away from the screen
Another version can be seen
She is black, and he is white
They love each other but they also fight
Back from work, she's not home
Another evening angry, all alone
She arrives and he departs
Misunderstandings, then the breakdown starts

Here we are late at night
We are both refugees
There is no easy way
...
