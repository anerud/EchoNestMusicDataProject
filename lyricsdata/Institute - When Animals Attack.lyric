These nights are getting longer
Seems like I've always been awake
There is danger in the houses
A nemesis in shape

She took my metal bones
Placed them where I could feel again
You know how bad things get

When animals attack, you need fire
When animals attack, you need fire

Nine lives for the madmen
Trouble for the sane
What is good for your survival
...
