Don't ask me why, don't ask me why
I joined the army, The Salvation Army
But it didn't help
Don't ask me why, don't ask me why
I joined the army, but it drove me barmy
And it didn't help

Hideous towns make me throw up

Don't ask me why, don't ask me why
I went into service with The Civil Service
But it didn't help
Don't ask me why, don't ask me why
I went into service, but it made me nervous
And it didn't help

Ooh, hideous towns made me throw up
...
