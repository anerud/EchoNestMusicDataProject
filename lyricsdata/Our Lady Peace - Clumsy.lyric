Throw away the radio, suitcase keeps you awake
Hide the telephone, the telephone
Telephone, in case you realize
That some days, you're just not okay
You'll level off, you'll level off, you'll level off

And it's not alright now
You need to understand
There's nothing strange about this
You need to know your friends
You need to know that

I'll be wavin' my hand
Watching you drown
Watching you scream
Quiet or loud

And maybe you should sleep
And maybe you just need, a friend
As clumsy as you've been
There's no one laughing
...
