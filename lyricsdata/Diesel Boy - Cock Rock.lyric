I admit its true
I still like Motley Crue
Metallica and the Number of the Beast
Cuz Faster Pussycat rocks and so does Judas Priest
I love the spandex that they wear
I saw Dio when he had hair
Well I know metal is dead
But I love to bang my head and throw my fists up into the air
I know Ozzy Osbourne's old
