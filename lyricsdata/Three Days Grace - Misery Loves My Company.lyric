I am in control
I haven’t lost my mind
I’m picking up the pieces of the past you left behind

I don’t need your condescending
Words about me, looking lonely
I don’t need your arms to hold me
‘Cause misery is waiting on me

I am not alone
Not beating down just yet
I am not afraid
Of the voices in my head

Down the darkest road
Something’s almost dead
I am not alone
‘Cause misery loves my company
...
