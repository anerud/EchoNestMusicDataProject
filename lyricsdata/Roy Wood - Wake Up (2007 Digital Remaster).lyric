unlock the door
its time again to leave you
i miss you more each time i go away
if there's a chance i'll swim back home to please you
and post a line to reach you every day

wake up
wake up and let me see the smile upon your face
let's linger for a while upon our last embrace
give me just a thought to where
i'll still think you're there
quick before i dare to leave the place
