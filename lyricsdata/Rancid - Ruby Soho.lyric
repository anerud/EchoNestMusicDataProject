Echoes of reggae
Comin' through my bedroom wall
Havin a party up next door
But I'm sittin' here all alone
Two lovers in the bedroom
And the other starts to shout
All I got is this blank stare
And that don't carry no clout at all

Destination unknown
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho
Destination unknown
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho

He's singin' and she's
There to lend a hand
He's seen his name on the marquee
