Common weather comes with a name
And our knees our hands got the shakes
Cause when our backs about to break
We won't howl out or cry
We know we feel we try
In the middle of an everlasting fight

Every night we are tired,
We've been worked to the bone.
But nearly everyday we earn a lower wage,
Does it tell you what we're made of,
