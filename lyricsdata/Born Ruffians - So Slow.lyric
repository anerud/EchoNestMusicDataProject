I won't bleed if I don't recognize the disease
I don't see what is right out in front of me
the change can be so slight you hardly see
I believe I am healthy where I be

Thoughts can breed, but in light they remain a seed
stuck with me in a stupid tragedy
slow, slow speed and want for sympathy
slow is me in the throes of some disease
