Just gonna stand there and watch me burnWell that's alright because I like the way it hurtsJust gonna stand there and hear me cryWell, that's alright because I love the way you lieI love the way you lieI can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels likeAnd right now there's a steel knife in my windpipeI can't breathe but I still fight while I can fightAs long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flightHigh off of love, drunk from my hateIt's like I'm huffin' paint and I love it, the more I sufferI suffocate and right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates meShe fuckin' hates me, and I love itWait, where you going?
I'm leaving you, no, you ain'tCome back, we're running right back, here we go againIt's so insane, 'cause when it's going good, it's going greatI'm Superman with the wind at his backShe's Lois Lane but when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamedI snap, "Who's that dude?", I don't even know his nameI laid hands on her, I never stoop so low againI guess I don't know my own strengthJust gonna stand there and watch me burnWell that's alright because I like the way it hurtsJust gonna stand there and hear me cryWell, that's alright because I love the way you lieI love the way you lieI love the way you lieYou ever love somebody so much, you barely breathe when you with 'em?
