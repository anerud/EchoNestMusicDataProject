Intro:
Ah, yeah in the mothaf**kin house Black C and Mr. Cee from the
mothaf**kin Posse this is straight out the mothaf**kin lab, you know
what I'm sayin, the funk lab that is and we run this shit like this.

(Black C)
This some shit you can't f**k with out the funk lab
We got some game for you niggaz in big fat slabs
Like a pound or a key a G you can't be
Who the f**k you tryin to be and that G is me
We sucka-free a mothaf**kin menace
Coppers on the block but they hot
'cause they can't run up in this
And it's a daily routine my niggaz on the scene
Slangin that chronic and the cream
Ya know it's nothin but the funk
It's nothin but the funk that we want
And the bass to make the speakers bump
I heard that cash rules everything around
And niggaz from my hood nowday is livin foul
