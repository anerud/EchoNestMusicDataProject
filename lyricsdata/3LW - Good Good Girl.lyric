Verse 1
Should I give you some
that is the question
and will It change the way
you look at me

I had been so afraid
while you've been so patient
my mother would have a fit
if she could see

Chorus:
You made a good good girl
do a bad bad thing
Although my mind is strong
my body Isn't listening
see I know right from wrong
but my heart wont speak
...
