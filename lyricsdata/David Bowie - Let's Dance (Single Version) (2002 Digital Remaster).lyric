Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the songs they're playin' on the radio

Let's sway
While colour lights up your face
Let's sway
Sway through the crowd to an empty space

If you say run, I'll run with you
If you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall
Into my arms
