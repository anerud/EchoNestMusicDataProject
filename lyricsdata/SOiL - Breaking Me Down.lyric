LET IT GO

How far will a falling star take me
How far can I go can I go
Gotta be what the
nightmare made me
Gotta be gotta be what I see
Jump Clear of the
falling parts from me
How far will they go will they go
Can't give what you need
from me baby
Just let it go

Bringing me down
break me down sweet sugar
Bringing me down break me down
Breaking me down
to the ground sweet baby
