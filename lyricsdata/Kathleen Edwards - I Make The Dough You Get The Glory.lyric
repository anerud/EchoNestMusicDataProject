Blazing a trail to the Southern cities
From the streets of our hometown
Basement bars, we played from the heart
In the company of our friends

If I write down these memories
That I have saved away
Photographs of the years that have passed
Inside my little brain

You're cool and cred like Fogerty
I'm Elvis Presley in the 70s
You're Chateauneuf, I'm Yellow Label
You're the buffet, I'm just the table

I'm a Ford Temple, you're a Maserati
You're The Great One, I'm Marty McSorley
You're the Concord, I'm economy
...
