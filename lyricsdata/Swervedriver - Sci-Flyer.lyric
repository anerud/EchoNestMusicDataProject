Let's go and meet our friends
They said they'd be here today
They like to oscillate, they say it's great
They want to roller coaster ride

And drive into the depths of the dark night
They love the bright lights and the lay-by's too
And as the leaves blew up to the heavens
They said they knew

Just call me bucket rider
