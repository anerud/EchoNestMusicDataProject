(Alright) [x2]
Scary monsters
And super beasts
The more you dream the less you sleep, ah
Life as we know it
Has gone away
Unbound
Unwound
Who's here to stay, alright

Nobody's real but they're willing to let you know
Nobody's real but they'll feel it tonight
(Feel it tonight)
Nobody's real but they're willing to let you go
Nobody's real but they'll feel it

Nobody's real
