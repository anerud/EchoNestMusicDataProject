Jenny is all right
Somebody loves you tonight
Tomorrow we'll make a start,
smoke all them cigarettes

You are the star that sits in the sky,
the fire that burns when the battle is high,
the feeling that yearns when the yearning is all
in his heart, yeah, in his heart, yeah, in his heart

I know you wanna get away
I know nothing ever stays the same
And, Jenny, I've been thinking things over
I know thinking never got me far
