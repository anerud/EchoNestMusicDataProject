When all the salt is taken from the sea
I stand dethroned
I'm naked and I bleed
But when your finger points so savagely,
Is anybody there to believe in me
To hear my plea and take care of me?

How can I go on
From day to day
Who can make me strong in every way
Where can I be safe
Where can I belong
...
