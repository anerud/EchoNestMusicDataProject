I don't wanna waste an entire album on you, Ive been there done that yea. I don't wanna put all thee anger you cost me back on you, though i know ill be justified when i'm in another place, i don't wanna put any negative thoughts on this universe, i done it enough (ohhhhh) and i dont wanna tell who, what, when, where why, and how and how cause who cares?, dont nobody cares.

but i hope you soon find out how to love, once upon a time you wanted to learn, i thought i could teach you but you were more afraid, than willing. So when it comes don't push it away, one day you will find it is the greatest gift and i hope you don't take advantage of it again
