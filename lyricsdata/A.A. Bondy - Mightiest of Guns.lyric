You see the Sunday bird swinging low
The fever in your brain only grows
and The Murder Boys are running down the street
You can see 'em through the window from your seat
Hear the sound of the mightiest of guns

And the shadows go like ghosts across your road
Oh take the world and burn it in a spoon
...
