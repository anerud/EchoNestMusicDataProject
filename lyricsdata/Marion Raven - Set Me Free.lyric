Love makes you feel bad
Makes you so sad
But that's the way it goes
Hate makes you feel good
Like only pain could
But that's the way it goes

I won't feel that, and I
I won't feel bad, and I
I won't miss you when you're gone

Don't tell me you love me
Now that you need me
Don't tell me you want me
Just let me go
Won't you set me free?

Talk but no one's listening
All I hear is
Blah blah blah

All you do is hurt me
You do not deserve me
