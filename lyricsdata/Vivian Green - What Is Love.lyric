Maybe I am foolishly in love with someone that is
Not exactly on the same page, that I am on
Well all my friends keep telling me stop walking round so blindly
But when he calls they're not around to ever remind me

Maybe this isn't love
But if it isn't love then really what is love
Maybe I don't need to know what's really love
'Cause when he's around he's got me feeling some kinda way

Maybe this isn't love
But if it isn't love then really what is love
Maybe I don't need to know what's really love
'Cause when he's around he's got me feeling some kinda way

I guess I kind of notice he don't always act so kindly
But that doesn't stop my hunger, hunger for his heart
Why should I listen to those, who think that I should move on
Maybe what they see as drama, I see more as art
