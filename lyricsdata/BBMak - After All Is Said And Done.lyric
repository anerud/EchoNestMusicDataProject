I thought that you were working late
But that was when I made my first mistake
As you walk into the hall and sort all the clothes upon the floor
It was too late
She said she didn't understand
And then she cried she took the ring from off her hand
Then I knew it was over as she turned to me and said
Our love is dead

After all is said and done
Knowing I'll be only one
Till I head it out going out of the way
All alone under the sun
...
