Baby (baby. mmm)
What can I do to make you forgive me
For ever cheating on you
See I was a fool, I plead insanity
I throw myself at your mercy
So do what you will with me

Have mercy, mercy, mercy on me
For cheatin on you
I don't know what I was thinking
Cause nobody could do me like you

Have mercy, mercy, mercy on me
For cheatin on you
