Well if I ever see the morning
just like a lizard in the Spring
I'm gonna run out in the meadow
to catch the silence where it sings.

I'm gonna force the Serengeti
to disappear into my eyes
and when I hear your voices calling
I'm gonna turn just inside out.

Well if I ever get to slumber
just like a mole deep in the ground
hell, I won't be found.
