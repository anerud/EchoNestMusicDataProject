Focusin' When I Wanna Quit
Understand I Was Raised On Some Other Shit
What's The Pain To Ya'?
What's The Name To Ya'?
What's Shame To Ya'?
What's The Game and The Fame To Ya'?
These is The Questions That I ask Myself
Like The Haze and The Hashy For Help
Or Courvoisier Straight
A Parking Lot Full Of Thugs Parkin' In Late
Make Moves But Take Time Like a Chess Piece
Before I Start The Car, Four Dimes To The Chest Piece
Windows Ain't The Only Things Tinted
Niggas is Too, I Been Trynna Blow But it May Take Me a Minute
Shit, Time is Money Though
I'm On The Low But My Ghost Actin' Funny Though
He Sayin' Chill Nigga
