This staying alive can kill you
It's taking years off of my life
Build my world within you
But loneliness comes

You can cure you're iodine
The world is better for your grace
If I plead insanity
Can I still crash at your place?

There are only so many ambulances
To go around
There are only so many accidents
It's the universe coming down

Not trying to kill you
It's just proof of life
Not trying to kill you
...
