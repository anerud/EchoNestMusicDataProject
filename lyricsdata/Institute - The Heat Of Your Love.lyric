In the way that you state your feelings
No matter the cost
How you separate all the cliches
Still you get so lost
But I wish I was wrong
Wish I was wrong
There has never been anyone like you for me
There has never been anyone like you for me

Way down
Way down in the heat of your love
I'm my best side
Deep fried in the heat of your love

I been waiting impatiently
Searching dead lands
You've been gone for days now
