Somebody needs to tell me what I'm supposed to do
They say that I'm not supposed to be in love with you
They say that you're too weird for me
And you'll leave eventually
But then I'm the only one who ever believed in you

Somebody tell me what I'm looking to face
Everyone's saying that I'm just a part of your phase
