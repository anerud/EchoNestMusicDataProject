Sit back bare your cross to me
Oh won't I listen
Goddamn, have I burned my hands
On what's been missing

I feel unreal
Every time I try and stop to feel
Pick me up my friend
Let me start again

You fucked me
Behind this garden
Don't fuck with me

Long before I could even see
You're what was missing
Twisting deep inside of me
