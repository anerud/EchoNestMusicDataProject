Voice reminds of where we are, in a cement city... arrive

We gave it hell and we find ourselves coherent and so unclear
And I'm lost at sea with guides to spare, lost at sea with guides to spare
This is the sound waves of desperation

Ones of reminder and things that just won't heal and in time we will step away from this
Cause it's the hardest and longest, and in time we will make this disappear
