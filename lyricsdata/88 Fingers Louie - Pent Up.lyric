Whenever I'm alone with you I keep to myself
It's not because I'm bored with you it must be my health
I feel like I'm a little kid afraid to go to school
I lock myself inside my room and act like a fool

I don't know why and I don't miss it
I wanna cry and no one's listenin'
I don't know why? I don't know why?
