I sit and wait
does an angel contemplate my fate
And do they know
The places where we go
When we're grey and old
'cause I have been told
That salvation lets their wings unfold

So when I'm lying in my bed
Thoughts running through my head
And I feel that love is dead
I'm loving angels instead

And through it all she offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
