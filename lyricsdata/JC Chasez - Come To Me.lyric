Traveling through galaxies on telepathic roads
Singing in the distance, clouds of breath out in the cold
All of my desires waiting for someone to hold
So come to me
So come to me, ooh

Lying here pretending that you're closer than you are
Swear I heard you whispering "would someone break my fall?"
Memories of kisses fill my dreams until the dawn
So come to me
So come to me

The nights when you don't call
My life is a catastrophe
I need to feel you close to me
I'm waiting out the storm

Cause when I'm all alone
I imagine lying face-to-face
