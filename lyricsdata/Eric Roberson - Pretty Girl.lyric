(1, 2) badaaaaa, badaaa
ooooo oooooo ooo
oo oooooo ooo ooo oo hoooooo

[Verse 1:]
Pretty girl
Do you always use your smile
to get your way
Once in a while
Do you use your heart
Do find that hard to do pretty girl
Ooh oohh
Were you hurt by love beforee
Too much pain for your heart to endure
Is that why you hide
Behind a disguse ooh
Pretty girl oooh

[Chorus:] x2
One day your gonna wake up and find out
That a time can not rewind
While your out chasin' things
Seems like your flyin right past your dreams
I wanna know.who.you really are pretty girll
