Ooh... ooh...
Oh... oh... oh...
Oh... oh... oh...

When I look at you
What I see is my future wife-to-be
Only God Himself
More important in this life to me

You've been there for me
Nurtured and cared for me
Never left my side
In you I can confide

Love it (I love it)
Love it, love it (Everything about you)
Love it (I love it)
Love it, love it (Hey, good and the bad)

You know I love it (I love it)
Love it (Can't imagine life without you)
Love it (Oh...)
Love it, love it

Give me peace of mind
Conversations be so soothing
disagree sometimes
But it only shows were human

Cause I'll take one for ya
like you would the president
The love I have for you
one couldn't even measure it
...
