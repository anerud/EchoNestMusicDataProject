I missed the train to Boston,
Now I'm left in the Cold,
I never wanted this to end,
And now you got a new boyfriend,
He says he'll love you better,
Than I will ever do,
And will you say you love me too, oh!

Can't make up for past mistakes,
but you know I'm gonna keep on trying,
The world used to be ours to take,
Can't you see that now,
I'm dyin'

I know you broke your promise,
...
