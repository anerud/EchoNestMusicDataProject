Dolly, you better run - he ain't never gonna leave you
Never gonna see what a wreck you are
I know that you tried your best but you better slip away dear
You couldn't sabotoge it
You couldn't fuck it up

But maybe I'll come along if it's cool with you
Cuz Dolly you know I'd do anything for you
Dolly, Dolly oh babe anything for you
