Party people in the place to be
From the same man who brought you Da Bichez
Da Bichez, Da Bichez, Da Bichez
We were misunderstood last time we brought you
Ba Bichez, Da Bichez, Da Bichez
Now we gonna clear it up and let you make up your own mind like this

Now a queen's a queen and a whore is a whore
She felt if she made me wait I'd have more respect for her
Adore her eventually spendin' up my digits
She felt that love would make me buy her mad material shit

She likes to trick 'em, 'cause ain't nothin' like a sleepin' victim
East New York style stick 'em ha ha ha, stick 'em
Top rated game but if it's game I played it
Underestimated, swore the king was checkmated

She claims she loves my mind, 'cause I'm so intelligent
But fuck my mental, she was scheming on my mint
Evil intention, to deplenish the fund
She tried to juice me with the pussy 'cept for, the mask and gun

I was a fool to fall in lust with this evil genius, she had me by the nuts
She ain't got shit but man she loves it plush
Whippin' I whip, and suckin' up I canibus
Back in the days, I woulda scraped her for this caper
But I realize, it wasn't me it was the paper

Let me kick it, about the digits, that I've collected
Long distance, and disconnected, it's gettin' hectic
Before my record, they didn't show it
But now they throw it, hopin' that they'll get drunk off Moet or Cristal
