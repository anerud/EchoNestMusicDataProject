They wanted me to be the dream
My mood went south
And I'm stuck on the couch with bad jeans
And the couch sucks me down to the floor
And the floor sucks me down to the earth
And I'm covered and buried before
My heart had a chance to start workin'

Hey, it's heavy underground
I'm screamin' for attention
So come dig me out

And I said, "Hey somebody can you hear me now
'Cause my world is cavin' in"
So come dig me out
