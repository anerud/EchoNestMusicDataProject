One very happy warm summer night
I saw your face, what could I do?
So carefully I walked straight up to you

And in the shadow of a moonlit nite
I saw those eyes a shinin' through
Heart of gold, I love you misty blue

Oh it's hard to love somebody
Especially when they don't belong to you
'Cause they're loving someone else,
Strung out and hung up on you

I feel like Bogart in a crazy movie
