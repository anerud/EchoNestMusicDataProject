i feel so useless again, everything is out of my hands
and i can't survive, it's an emptiness inside me wishing someone would intie me
put me back at that control so i can steer the ship to safety
i've always been a sucker for happy endings
and i know i will look out in time as long as were still standing

and i don't know if i will still be breathing
...
