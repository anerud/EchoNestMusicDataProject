Been dazed and confused 
for so long, it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Lotsa people talkin', 
few of them know
Soul of a woman was created below, yeah

You hurt and abuse, 
tellin' all of your lies
Run 'round, sweet baby, lord, how they hypnotize
Sweet little baby, I don't know where you been
Gonna love you, baby, here I come again

Every day I work so hard, bringin' home my hard-earned pay
...
