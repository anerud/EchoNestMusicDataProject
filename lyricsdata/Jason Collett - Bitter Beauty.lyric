All the flowers fade
And all the star? s pale
As this bitter beauty
Grabs you by the tail

How long will you hesitate?
Half way up the trail
Yes, it's dark in the trees
And some wounds never heal

And you're dreamin'
With eyes wide open
Your heart has spoken
For the first time

All the gun-for-hire poets
Who try to sing so loud
Just to drown out the roar
As the bombs hit the ground

And the band is whistling Dixie
...
