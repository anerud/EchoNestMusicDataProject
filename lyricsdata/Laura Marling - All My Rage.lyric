Stole my children, left my son
Of all of them, he's the only one who did not mean that much to me
I tip my cap to the raging sea

My daughter, she's the pretty one
I married her off to the reverend's son
Now she lives in a sin-free world
Tip your cap to the brave old girl

Now all my rage been gone
Now all my rage been gone
...
