Fire... the burning path
Downstroy... the weak minds
Rising... nature's demise
Enslave... system creation

(Spoken word)
Iraq, Iran, Baghdad, Vietnam...
Lybia, Chechnia, Bogota, Belgrade...
Bosnia, Moscow, burning Jerusalem...
Pakistan, Kazakastan, Tel Aviv, Tehran

Everywhere is bloodshed
Wasteland, bloodshed

(Bloodshed, wasteland, and bloodshed,
wasteland, and bloodshed)
...
