Who is the naughtiest child?
Who drives their French teacher wild?
And when he's telling you lies
He looks you straight in the eye

Got kicked in the side
In the side, it's the same again
Got kicked in the hide
Must be then, it was now and then

He's got the social disease
J-J-J-John!
Grass stains and cuts on his knees
