When you look into his eyes
It comes to you as no surprise
It's always the same
Every time he's out with you
He tries to tell you what to do
You don't need it that way

Sometimes you think you're playing the fool
He's running around breaking all the rules
Somehow that don't seem fair
There's got to be a better way
You know what I'm trying to say

'Cause deep, deep down inside
You're living in a life in total lies

What did he ever do for you
What's he trying to put you through
I just don't understand

You showed him love and tenderness
Touched him with your sweet caress
Now he's leaving you
