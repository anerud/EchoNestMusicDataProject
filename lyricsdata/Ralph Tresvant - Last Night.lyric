to long ive waited for this moment
tormented by the thought that i could lose a good thang
not yet, i havent completed my mission
only wishing that you could be my only lover
know i support, guilty of the charge that i commited
don't wanna be aquitted baby, just forgive all my sins
my heart is reaching out, after all i put you through
i need you more and more, oh yes i do

can't you see, girl that i've changed
