I'm done... loving
Ooh done... yeah, loving

(VERSE 1)
I'm in no need for love
Stretched this sister more than a mile
It's not for me because
There's no trust in love, so I'm restin' a while
How could u do me this way, love?
I can't recall how you made me smile
And I don't have time to play (with ya)
If I see ya, make it worth my while
Until then...

(CHORUS)
I'm done... loving
(I'm done) Ooh done, yeah... loving
...
