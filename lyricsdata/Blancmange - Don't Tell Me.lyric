I'll stay with you until the end
I say you'll let me be your friend
I'll say you'll let me in the end
I just want to be your friend.

How can I be sure you're breaking all the rules
How can I be sure I should be high above
I climbed a mountain reaching for the skies
And all too soon I jump the moon and find I'm losing my mind.

Don't tell me I'm the howling wind
Don't tell me you're the wounded star
And don't tell me I'm the devil's friend
Don't tell me
Don't tell me
...
