I thought you were the sweetest kill
Did I even know?
And all the time we thought we did
Was it just for show?

If they try to pull you out
Would you even go?
I thought you were the sweetest kill
Did you even know?

I held your hand until the light
The scars were on the back
And all the time we were the right
Was it just retract?

And they can try to put you down, wear you out
...
