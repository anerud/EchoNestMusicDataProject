Slipped through the window by the back door
Caught short in transit with my love
Jumped up, fell back, cut off from romance
How could I fall without a shove?
Tiptoe like thunder on my feelings
You rock me gently with your sighs
My knees are weak, my head is reeling
Consumed by fire in your eyes...
Don'tcha know why?
Goodness no! Why?
Stepped in and shattered my defenses
