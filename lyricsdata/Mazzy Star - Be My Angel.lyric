they say it's me
that makes you do things
you might not have done
if I was away
and that it's me
that likes to talk to you
and watches you
as you walk away

don't say it's useless
don't say forget it
don't bring me wishes
of silly dreams
just say there's often
too much freedom
too many fingers
and too many things

they say it's you
...
