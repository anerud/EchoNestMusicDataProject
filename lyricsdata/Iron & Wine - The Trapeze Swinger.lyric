Please remember me happily
By the rosebush laughing
With bruises on my chin
The time when we counted every black car passing

Your house beneath the hill and up until
Someone caught us in the kitchen
With maps, a mountain range, a piggy bank
A vision too removed to mention

But please remember me fondly
I heard from someone you're still pretty
And then they went on to say that the pearly gates
Had some eloquent graffiti

Like 'We'll meet again' and 'Fuck the man'
And 'Tell my mother not to worry'
And angels with their gray handshakes
Were always done in such a hurry

And please remember me at Halloween
Making fools of all the neighbors
Our faces painted white by midnight
We'd forgotten one another

And when the morning came, I was ashamed
