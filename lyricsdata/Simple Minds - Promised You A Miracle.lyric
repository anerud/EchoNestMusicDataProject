Promised you a miracle.
Belief is a beauty thing.
Promises promises,
As golden days break wondering.

Chance as love takes a train.
Summer breeze and brilliant light.
Only love she sees,
He controls on love,
Love sails to a new life.

Promised you a miracle.
Belief is a beauty thing.
Promises promises,
As golden days break wondering.

Only love she sees.
He controls on love.
Life mirrors a cure.
Everything is possible,
With promises.
