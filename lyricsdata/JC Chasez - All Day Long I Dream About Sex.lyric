So you wanna be a rock star
Keep it going don't stop
Work it while your on top
Call the cops
Roller coaster riding baby
Up and down I love to watch you do it
I just want to get close to you
Find out what it takes to move you
Feel the rhythm
Hit the spot
Get it hot
All night long

All day long I dream about sex
And all night long I think about sex
And all the time I think about sex with you, with you
All day long I dream about sex
