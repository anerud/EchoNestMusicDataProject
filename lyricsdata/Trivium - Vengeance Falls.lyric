I am outnumbered
My vision blurred
I'm absorbed by rage
The outcome turns
Bit the hand
Greater man
When you wrought my wrath
Your end began
You broke me down
A shattered crown
I shoveled deep
And tried to drown
This attack
Turned life black
So I built this flame
To burn you back

We start this fire
Just to burn it all
From the dark desire
Our vengeance falls
