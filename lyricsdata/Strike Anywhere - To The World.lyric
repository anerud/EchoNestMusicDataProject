Look how the ruts cling to my footsteps
The fatal invisible tool
By which we define, we fight for our approval
And fear our removal from the safety of fools

From the tidal forces of our positions
Not won, not one to take for granted
Are our rebel hymns incanted
To sing in the mines of the fortunate sons?

Brothers in spirit, sisters in rage
Will we live out our lives in this concrete cage?

Another heartbeat lost, another police murder
Buried in the public, eyes on the back page
Heartbeat lost in a new world order
Hobbled and bound but still walking away

I pledge allegiance to the world
Nothing more, nothing less than my humanity
I pledge allegiance to the world
Searching for vision, not invisibility

I pledge allegiance to the world
Searching for vision, not invisibility
I pledge allegiance to the world
