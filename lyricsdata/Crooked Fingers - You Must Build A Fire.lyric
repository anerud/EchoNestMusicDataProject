Oh gracious love,
You were so kind to me
You only broke my heart
Let my arms and legs stay strong

So I could swim upon the open sea
Searching for another love
Floating along aimlessly

I will wait for you another night
Cause I know you won't leave be behind

Oh, where are you love?
I had someone--a love I thought was true
