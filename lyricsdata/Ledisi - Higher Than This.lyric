Light that reflects in the mirror
Showing the essence of who I am
Made from pure perfection
I'm connected to the one, therefore I am

One to rise above all the ugliness
Evolve into a world of selflessness
I can see love and no love can be higher than this
What can be higher than this?

What can be higher than this?
What can be higher than this?
What can be higher than this?
You will find love, and no love can be higher than this

Feeling like everything going wrong
Take a step back and edit yourself
There's a hero in you waitin' to happen
Make the choice to take a chance and save yourself

You gotta let go of your insecurity
Explore the passion in your possibilities
You will find love and no love can be higher than this
