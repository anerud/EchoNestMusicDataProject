Combat boots and a scratched up record
Signed by the hero of long ago
A pair of vans, some torn up blue jeans
This is his world, that's what he knows

He's gonna find a girl who thinks like he does
Gonna grow older but never old

Heard his first punk song when he was sixteen
'Minor Threat' I think it was
Twenty-four, now he hates his job
