One, two
Can you hear me?
Yo, Fakts One's again, yeah
Yo, my name is Akrobatik and I don't smoke crack
I won't buy the rhyme if I think the beats whack
I don't shoot smack or pop pills to get loose
And I don't drink liquor it causes spousal abuse
Plus I don't smoke cigarettes
So you won't see me on the patch or chewing on no nicorette
I don't pack heats, but if I did you couldn't hold it
And I wont smoke a spliff unless I see you role it
I don't talk shit, shit-talkers are mostly feeble
Don't look down on my people, we all equal
I don't watch videos, they all the same
Don't preoccupy myself with glamour, fortune and fame
The mic a fight but don't sleep the head skills is tight
So don't be the one to break my peaceful streak, aight?
I don't do none of that shit
But if I do it's just because I'm hypocrite just like you
