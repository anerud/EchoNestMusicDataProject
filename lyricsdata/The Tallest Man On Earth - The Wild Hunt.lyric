There is a crow moon coming in well you keep looking out
It is the hollow month of march now sweeping in
Lets watch phenomenons that rise out of the darkness now
Within the light she is my storming heroine

And old machines abandoned by the ancient races stand
I hear them humming down below in hollow earth
Oh hell I guess I know in a while I will go under too
But just for now I let the spring and storm return

I left my heart to the wild hunt a-comin
I live until the call
...
