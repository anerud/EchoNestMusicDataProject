Intro
Buenos dias senor let's have a Havanna
The soul of Cuba el vero Havanna

Verse
In my mind I can fly away
We can dance with a little romance
Swing your hips from side to side
Ooh la la the casino salsa
Hello amigo, follow the moves
Push your hand up in the air
4123 do the cabolina
Ooh la la the casino salsa

Bridge
Swing and turn everybody salsa
Let's go round come and do the dance now
