Stronger than reason
Stronger than lies
The only truth I know
Is the look in your eyes
... The look in your eyes

Just like a car crash
Just like a knife
My favorite weapon
Is the look in your eyes
You've run out of lies

You've run out of lies
You've run out of lies
You've run out of lies
You've run out of lies
You've run out of lies
You've run out of lies
...
