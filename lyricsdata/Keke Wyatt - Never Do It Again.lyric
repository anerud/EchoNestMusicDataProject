oww oww oww oww

no no no no no 
i won't do it again
no no no no no
i won't do it again
 
verse 1
what kind of woman
would rather me in the mall
then to spend her time with you
and she spending your tol to (what the hell was i thinking)

and what kind of women
dont never wait up for you
when she knows your coming home
you might as well be sleeping alone

chorus
(and i most admit)
that im the one who's being charged 
(and i most admit)
that its me that did you wrong
i did you bad but i've learned
i hope you hear my words
i gotta make it right with you

so give me a chance
im not the same woman
i learend my leason
i promiss i won't do it again
no no no no
i swear i'll be with love again

ima start speaking when you come through the door
i aint gonna be trippin with that attitude nomore
