Fire burning in a hill
The lines are rocky rough
Red angels wait to pick remains
The cindered shoulder
Of confused men
Seperate from their awe
With grey desire
He looks out mad
His soft grey indigo eyes
Indigo eyes ...
Asking

His heaven is uncovered not
A black tree blocks his way
His way is skating round a dome
...
