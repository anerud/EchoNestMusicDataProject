Up with the evening sun
The river rolls on by
the neighbors, they tell secrets,
the neighbors they tell lies
and somewhere the plane went down
these things they never stop
somebody feels the knife
and somebody calls the cops

Oh, The living and the dying how easily you bruise
Oh Delia don't go round when the devils loose.
