Everyday just seems so long
Every minute that I'm here without you
Will tomorrow ever come?
Will I ever get the chance to feel you?

I need you so much

You're out of reach, you're out of reach but you're so close
You're out of reach, you're out of reach but you're so close
You're out of reach, you're out of reach but you're so close
I hear you call, I feel you fall but you're out of reach
