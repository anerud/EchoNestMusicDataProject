do you pray, in the night?
can you appreciate the winds?
I would kill, I would fight
I need you close to sing,
it's the same beginning

gone away
it's the same old, same old song
gone away
it's my whole life in words

I can't breathe, when you cry
I'll be there to hold you tight
I would kill, I would fight
to keep you close, I'll keep singing the same way
