It's crazy but I'm frightened by the sound of the telephone, oh yeah
I'm worried that the caller might have awful news, oh my
Who knows these days where on earth the money goes, oh yeah
No doubt we could put it to a better use, oh my
You keep insisting that nobody showed you how to keep relationships, oh yeah
Your daddy made a real good try, oh my
You said you knew all along we could work it out, oh yeah
Do you have to make a fuss everytime we fly
Ooh I'm looking for clues
I'll have to make an effort now just to be serious, oh yeah
Nobody's gonna give you the benefit of the doubt, oh my
