I’m itchin’ on a photograph
Yeah I'm scratching on a thermostat
I’m giving up on looking back
I’m letting go of what I had.

I’m itchin’ on a photograph
Yeah I'm scratching on a thermostat
I'm letting go all of that I had
I’m itchin’ on a photograph.

Still the rain come down and you know now
Put the fire out, you'll burn.
