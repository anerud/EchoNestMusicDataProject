Searching, Wandering
Looking for the perfect specimen
Still pure, immature
Acknowledged sickness concealed, swaggering
Unseen, stalking
Ascertain the prey
Creeping quietly

Gracious second skin
Courteous facade accepted
The cultured do not harm
Fitting in amongst the sheeple

Purpose clear
Sheltered secret
Unsoiled inceptive
Infantile delight
The itch that needs attention
...
