He's like a king without a crown
He wears it like a clown
Watch him disappear
I wish he would come down
So call before you drown
I won' t always be around

Living for the bottle
He's living for the bottle

He's a ship without a sail
He's not listening when you speak
Living for the bottle
He'll be sitting there all week
So call before you drown
...
