I know a girl who's tough but sweet
She's so fine, she can't be beat me
She's got everything that I desire
Sets the summer sun on fire

I want Candy
I want Candy
I want Candy
I want Candy

Go to see her when the sun goes down
Ain't no finer girl in town
You're my girl, what the doctor ordered
So sweet, you make my mouth water

I want Candy
