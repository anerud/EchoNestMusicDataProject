(Dre Dog)
Nigga it's the J to the I to the M to the J O N E S
Nigga in the flesh
Chewy boy doobie with the buddha cess
I'm like the Lion King cause everything I see is mines
And Tommy Tuckers man they stop and fuck us like a sign
So read my mind, the situation's critical
And off that chewy man shit can get like (? britical?)
You think you know me? Well test your luck and try me out
And watch me treat you like a cow in a slaughterhouse
That cutty chrome, that microphone
That new Jim Jones, that indo zone
That watch that valium on your dome
I'm putting beary fairy niggas in a state of shock (shock!)
And I'm a killa whale but nigga check my pimp block
So bust that, crush that, crush that
Cuh-crack crack!
That's how that nigga's neck snap
I'm harmon like that (?'move a ree?)
Deadly like that Octagon
