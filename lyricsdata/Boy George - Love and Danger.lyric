Oh darling, the darkness is on our side
I wonder if you will surrender
She's waiting for you, but so am I
Ambiguous, so beautiful, that's life

Who made the rules, coz, the rules ain't fun
If you're loving us two, who's the lonely one?
Got addicted to love and danger

Love and danger
Love and danger
Love and danger
