I try my best to reach perfection
And all I get is more rejection
I wanna know what you're about

It's nice to know someone's out there asking
But what's it worth when it's all you're telling?
I think it's you I've finally figured out

Those outright lies you've said are knocking me down
What's left to do when your life's turned upside down?
