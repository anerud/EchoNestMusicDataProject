Get out a map, carve out a path path
Highlight it in fluorescent yellow
From the mountain pass to the prairie grass
Anywhere you'll go I'll follow

And if we don't speak after you leave
I'll look to the sky for smoke signals
If I fall behind, could you leave me a sign
Breadcrumbs in the shape of an arrow

See I'm going to hell
In a basket I made
Woven from the letters
and it spells your name
...
