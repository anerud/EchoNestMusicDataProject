Here I come again now, baby
Like a dog in heat
Tell it's me by the clamor now baby
I like to tear up the street,

Now I been smokin for so long,
Ya know I'm here to stay
Got you in a stranglehold, baby
You best get outta the way

The road I cruise is a bitch now, baby
But no, you can't turn me round
And if a house gets in my way, baby
Ya know I'll burn it down
