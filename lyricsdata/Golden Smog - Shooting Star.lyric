Alternate between the two. I left my guitar at home so here's an
Approximation of chord locations.
|A|E|D|A|
|A|E|G|A|

A E D A
Johnny was a school boy when he heard his first Beatles song
A E G A
Love Me Do, I think it was and from there it didn't take him long
Got himself a guitar, used to play every night
Now he's in a rock & roll outfit, and everything's all right
A E

Johnny told his Momma, Hey Momma I'm goin' away
I'm gonna hit the big time, gonna be a big star someday
