Only the gods know
They're looking right through you
Straight into the eyes of a dead man
There isn't enough hours in the day
What will be seen
When your world comes crashing down
Staring in the eyes of a gone man

No more fuckin' time left on your side, on you side
All of your hopes and dreams - don't mean shit!
