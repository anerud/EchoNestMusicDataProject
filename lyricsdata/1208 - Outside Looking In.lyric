Somebody told him that their way was the right way
He never had a chance, he never had a chance
'Cause he was force fed
He had to live his death sentence to see

He was a new face with a nice smile
He got sucked in, got spit out
He was the winner by the standards of a gold digger
A success story in six figures

From the outside looking in
It was wasted life on a dream
On the outside looking in, he was wasted
Turn your back to the world
