Say, lady, can I ask you why
You're treating me like a step child
With a future not so bright
I thought you said
You would never be that way to me
You said you'd never leave me for the rest of my life
I believe you all the times you said, baby
You're always on my mind
I don't believe you
So save those words you said to me
And I'll be on my way
I've got to say goodbye baby
BRIDGE:
You didn't want my love
That's what starts the pain, baby
