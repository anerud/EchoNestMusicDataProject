Don't look back, a new day is breakin 
It's been too long since I felt this way 
I don't mind where I get taken 
The road is callin, today is the day 

I can see, it took so long just to realize 
I'm much too strong not to compromise 
Now I see what I am is holding me down 
I'll turn it around 

I finally see the dawn arrivin 
I see beyond the road I'm drivin
