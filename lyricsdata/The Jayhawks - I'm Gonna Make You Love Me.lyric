The world never ends
It's only the beginning
And we can't pretend
To discover it's meaning

We talked for hours at a time
Then I came to my senses
You're more than a friend
You're my perfect lover

I'll never be all you want me to
But that's all right

I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna dry your tears
And we're gonna stay together
For a million years
...
