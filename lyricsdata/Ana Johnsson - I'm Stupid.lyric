I'm stupid, you're smarter
I'm stupid, thinking there's a way
this could turn out right

I'm dreaming, you woke up
I should have known from the start
that you were never mine

'Cause if I can't make you love me
you're out of reasons to stay
Make it easy on yourself
Don't worry about me
Can't make you feel something you don't
