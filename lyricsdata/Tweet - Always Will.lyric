(verse)
You keep telling me... me... me
That I'm way too sure
Of you loving me long time
But I bet you always will

In so many ways
I've rubbed off on you
And you been loving me long time
And I bet you always will
We're inseparable
'Cause your soul's with mine
And you been loving me so long
And I bet you always will

(chorus)
We could be on separate planets
Mars and Venus, heart to heart
...
