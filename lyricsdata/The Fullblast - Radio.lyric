It wont be from a lack of trying,
How many times did I watch you dying?
You say you'll try but you're really lying
You fade and fade until you're no longer there…
It wont be from a lack of trying,
How many times did I watch you dying?
You say you'll try but you're really lying
You fade out and fade and fade and fade…

And I can watch it happen,
Right before my very eyes…
And I can feel it sinking,
And forever change our lives…
It's like I'm on a cruise ship,
And I see a ship wreck…
And I can't bare these tortured screams
From everyone on board…
The entire crew dies,
And I'm so useless,
To do anything but dream…
