Intro: ryzarector, grym reaper

Aiyyo reaper, those kids out there say you're mad thirsty
You got somethin for them to drink?
Yo we can wet up two cups of blood

Verse one:

Arm to the leg, leg, on to the head! yo

Don't go against the grain, mad slang is my thang
I leave the hearty party with a bang buzza
