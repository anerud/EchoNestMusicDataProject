OOh, girls it's what you say between
a phrase it's written on your face.
It's rain against the window pain.
The sounds it makes, it's dreamin the day away
It's the shine of a precious pearl
light of the world, the sound of our baby girl.
It's finding a moment for a thought so pure.
It's walking along the shore.
I hold onto the feelings,
cuz i dont know when i will feel it again
