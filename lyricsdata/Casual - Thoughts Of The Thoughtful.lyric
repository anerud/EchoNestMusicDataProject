Verse one:

Start with the boom!
That's the sound from the stuff that we, puff
It's magic I'm draggin a foe to doom
And still refrain from being blunt
The tough get snuffed for being, lame
We men claim to be all that
Call back, I'll get wit cha
All act fat, frontin they really are close to me
But I'm prone to roast a poster like I'm supposed to be
Toast of the, and only me
Put your cups together, for the clever
Competition I'm just here with no limits
Cause I collapse your sad scraps like nimitz
Once I get in it, I'll put, my soul in
I believe I deceive just to leave your ears swollen
...
