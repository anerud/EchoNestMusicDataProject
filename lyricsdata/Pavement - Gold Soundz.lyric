Go back to those gold soundz
And keep my advent to your self
Because it's nothing I don't like
Is it a crisis or a boring change?
When it's central, so essential,
It has a nice ring when you laugh
At the low life opinions
And they're coming to the chorus now...

I keep your address to myself
'Cause we need secrets
We need secrets crets crets crets crets crets
Back right now
