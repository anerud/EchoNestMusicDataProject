Memories haunting my evenings,
eyes watching me through the moon
i hope my good days aren't over
not so soon...
i never have seen an angel
i gave up watching the sky
whisper softly to me honey
but don't lie, don't you lie

i still see you when my eyes are closed
and tell me why i can't let go
i still smell you inside of my clothes
oh, honey

someday i'll go for the glory
...
