I'll stare at the moon when the sun break down
And feel the pain of that anger
I laugh then smirk put my thoughts to work
And caught a flashback of me six feet beneath the earth
I heard a voice inside my head
Like james earl jones now my mind starts to rom like a cellular phone
I'm having visions of death but nobody's understanding me
What can it be it's calling me like brandon lee
Haunting me taunting me to go for a kill for no apparent reason
Except fo ra thrill a biographic imaging scanner
Capable of multi phasic resolution
Couldn't even penetrate inside my skull
Resistance so what's the main purpose of my existence
I hear it I feel it he stealing my dreams
Give it back give it back and stay out of my brain
And stop making false illusions to keep me insane with these visions
First the metamorphosis
No I metamorphasize in visions
20/20 right in front of your eyes I awaken
Shakin like the earth I'm quakin
And I'll fricasee any
Android or humanoid MC
