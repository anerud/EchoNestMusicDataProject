I know how to play this game
One, two, three and I'm safe
Count real slow to five
You couldn't keep me around if you tried

I know how to beat the rage
Of my tender age
Touch me once in the hall
But don't look back and don't call

There are some things I can hardly say
You've got me feeling a brand new way
Please don't let this be summerlong
