Here it comes, subject the terror you forgot
No memories from the past
The unexplainable starts to appear
As your sub-consciousness begins to come back again

Reality fades away
You try to find a solution
Here it's coming now, indecision
You freak as you can't see through all the confusion

There is no time, no time to regret
The eraser's coming for your life
You got to run, stay away from the light
...
