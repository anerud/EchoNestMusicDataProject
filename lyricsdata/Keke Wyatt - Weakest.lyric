I'm just thinking, babe
Maybe you and I can spend a weekend here
In a bed 'cause I don't know if I have the strength
To get away from your loving oh, ohh

I'm getting weaker, babe
Every other minute, uh, when you all up in it
It don't ever finish, boy, you know you're driving me crazy
Going insane for your loving, no, oh, whoa

Now I'm at my weakest, loving so loud
We're busting all the speakers, all on the ground
And my body's calling for you but you barely can hear
I can't speak 'cause I'm weak, it's clear, whoa, oh

That you'll never ever stop what you be doing
Take it to the floor and we still making love
Right there, right there, you know where you going
Don't know what you're doing to me

And we crawling out for more, we crawling on the floor
We crawling at the bed, bed and it really had me
We get weaker, weakest I've ever been, oh
But don't worry I can handle it
