A man gives me the book of God and I turn to him and said
"I wouldn't be here my friend if I had no faith
Here in the darkness I became the light
I had to get it wrong to get it right"

(Pre-1)
He crossed himself and I shook my head
He said "Jesus loves you, don't you know?"

()
My God is bigger than your god
My God is better than yours
Put your palms away
You need a little more faith
Don't you know what your heart is for?
