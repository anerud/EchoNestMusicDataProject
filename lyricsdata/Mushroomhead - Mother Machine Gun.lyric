Can we make progress - Have we learned our lesson
How can we take the test - Without the questions
The mind will play Pontius - The hearts the defendant
The soul is the conscience - You're the next contestant

Some how the greatest point comes without reason
Some how my made up mind acts without thinking right

Interrogate the truth until you hear what you like

Now I can't understand what keeps me going there is no master plan
Nothing to go on to grow on
Believe in - Everything leaves me cold
Too many promises - Not enough evidence of my soul
Interrogate the truth until you hear what you like
Nothing to go to grow on
