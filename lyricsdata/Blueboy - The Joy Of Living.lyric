we find a room
a chance to explore the things we both need
a candle burns so how did i get in this mess?
how did i stop feeling less?
i don't know
all i wanted to say was i'm so happy
of course it's not love
but i'm not choosey
smash through my heart
feel it crack like a star in the sky seeks oblivion
