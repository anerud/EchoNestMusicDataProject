In my last years with him there were bruises on my face
In my dawn and new day, I finally got away
But my head's all messed up and he knows just what to say
No more dawn and new days, I'm goin' back to stay
So why say bye-bye?
When it only makes me cry
I still light up like a candle burnin' when he calls me up
I still melt down like a candle burnin' every time we touch
Oh, say what you will, he does me wrong and I should be gone
But I still be lovin' you baby and it's much too much
We are going down 'cuz you're always getting high
