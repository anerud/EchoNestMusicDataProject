Cruising on the highway with my friends, top down
And we're all on our way to the beach.
And everyone keeps laughing at the those we are passing,
as we're sucking down that bonnie, bonnie weed.

Oh yeah

And we're rolling up to sand
Take your shoes off, man
We are skinny dipping underneath the sea
And it's a chicken fight (plan?)
Throw your dukes up, (Lamb?)
We are splashing in the water to the beat.
