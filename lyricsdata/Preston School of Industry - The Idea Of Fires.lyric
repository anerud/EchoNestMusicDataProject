Optometrist to the stars
Had it lucky with tarot cards
Well, everyone knows you believed it
You fooled no one with your style
Well, try this meanwhile
Everyone knows you can see it

Consequence

Well, you cashed the man with gasoline
Then you take out half his spleen
Everyone knows that you'll leave him
