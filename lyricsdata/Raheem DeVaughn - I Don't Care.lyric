They can hate if they wanna
I don't care, yeah
I said, let them hate if they wanna
Goin' nowhere

They can hate if they wanna
Let them hate if they wanna
Goin' nowhere

All your friends keep sayin' you can do better
With somebody else
Sayin' I'm dangerous and you can do bad
All by yourself

Everybody got somethin' to say
And they don't even wanna see
While they're talkin' so badly
I actually make you happy

All that matter is us anyway
And I don't even give a damn
For you I'm a better man
So tell them what they want to hear, baby

Let them talk about us
(They can hate if they wanna)
I don't care
(I don't care)
No matter what they say about us
(Let them hate if they wanna)
We ain't goin' nowhere
(Goin' nowhere)

Everybody says you're too slow for me
