We're doing a sequel,
We're back a popular demand.
Comon on everybody, strike up the band
We're doing a sequel
That's what we do in Hollywood
And everybody knows

I thought it was the end
But no my friends this is
when we get to do it all again (Do it all again)
Until the credits role
We got another goal to show,
That we can do it all again
