Boy u come, just in time
Im feelin like, like I wanna ride
I still have some positions, that I still aint done, let me have my fun
wipped creme strawberries, down your back, add cherries, aint nobody got to know my name, assume the position Adina's on a mission
And it starts as...

(One)come over 
(Two)turn over
(Three)remeber
(Four)your a freak like me
(Five)Im on my knee
(Six)Im beggin please 
Nobody's gonna do u like me 

My nasty grind (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
My nasty grind (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
My nasty grind (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Nobody's gonna do u like me

Now meet me in the shower, in about a hour
Wash my back and I'll wash yours
Take you to the bedroom, I'm in a sexy mood
You do me and watch as I do you
Two bodies vibrating, your man hood is escalating
Tongues touch, bodies trace, turn over
I don't wanna see your face
Kiss yo neck, back, toes, what's next

(One)come over
