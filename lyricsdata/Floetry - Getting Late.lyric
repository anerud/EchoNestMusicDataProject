Baby
Ooo baby
Baby, baby
Ooo baby
We need to um talk about where
We're taking this thing
How far we're gonna let this go
We've been here before
It's getting late

It's getting late
Why you gotta be here?
Beside me, watching, needing, wanting me
I'm afraid, don't be
I'm afraid, don't be
I'm so scared that you'll hurt me, twice
Baby, oh baby baby baby

Listen, I've already been thinking
About you on my mind far too often for you
To be here at this time, you see
One hands on mine and the other's on my thigh
Look, I already played with the idea of you
Being here in the morning
And the position for the crack of dawn
And the conversations before the yawning
But aah, it's getting late, it's getting late

It's getting late
Why you gotta be here?
Beside me, watching, needing, wanting me
But I'm afraid, you say, don't be
