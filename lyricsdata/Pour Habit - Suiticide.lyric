Kill all the lights
Quiet goes the door
Buy a headstone with no name
Eyes cold stare burn through the night
Silence is deadly but refined
Wait for him with patient steady breathing
Down my neck and spine

It's a lonely world, when you're only here to die
It's a lonely world, when you're killing to survive
Suiticide, it's a life of kill or be killed
...
