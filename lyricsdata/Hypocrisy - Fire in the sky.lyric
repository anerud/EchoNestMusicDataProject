Yeah!
Like a fire in the sky, they came to earth
To put the life on the run, to hide and observe
Basic destruction and chaos
People running for their lives
Secret abduction for their research
You can scream but you can' t hide

Running from the shadow
Can I ever be free?
Struggling for my life
What do they want from me?
