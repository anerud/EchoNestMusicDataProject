We see the billboard girl
The one devoted to ritual
Standing in the rain
Holding all her pain inside

I know you're hurting now
But I can't point my finger at the
Words I should or shouldn't say
Anything to take the pain away

To walk alone on the streets tonight
And fear nothing
To choose to love what we are in this life
And shine brighter

Don't let the crosses and dollar signs, symbols of man, unkind
Make you feel that you're not real
All this time, walk out
Out of the shadows

We see the lines in chalk
The warning sign for where we walk
In the shadows of the city's maze
...
