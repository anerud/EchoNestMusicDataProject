Put-put-put your hands together 
For the silver bullet make me 
Put-put-put your heads together 
For the cause and cure we're waiting 

Digging through and past the center 
Of the earth go straight 
Play the scientist and vandal 
Sweating either way 

Put-put-put your hands together 
For the silver bullet make me 
Put the voice of the idol maker 
Rising definite and shaking 

Pick your gift for accident for 
Wrapped it in skintight 
Pull the strings that make this thing 
...
