[19 second skit about a drug addict headed to jail]

[Opio]
Say what?
Listen baby brother, don't let 'em take your 'etti from ya
Keep a razor your under your sleeve, don't be afraid to cut 'em
And you can always count on me
I'll be your foundation in this foul nation (every day)
I'm out chasin money and dreams
Funny it seems, funny it seems I'm wastin time
But just be patient, I got the ace in the hole/whole
life of the entertainer out to her centerfold
It gets distracting, caught up in the interaction
of feminine attraction, they get the backspin
and flare when I break 'em, beware don't mistake 'em
for a square or a fake when the air starts to get thin
I put my gas mask on, poison can permeate
Private eyes blasting, scream with the 38
Clashin with Branch Davidians in the dirty state
Raelians, make full blown clones, it takes 30 days

[Chorus]
Tryin to escape, you wanna fly away
Feelin like you gotta stay high everyday
But it's always consequences and a price to pay
