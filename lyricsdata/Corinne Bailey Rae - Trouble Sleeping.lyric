It's late and I'm feeling so tired
having trouble sleeping.
This constant compromise
between thinking and breathing

could it be I'm suffering
because I'll never give in
won't say that I'm falling in love
tell me I don't see myself
couldn't I blame something else
don't say I'm falling love

some kind of therapy
is all I need
please believe me
some instant remedy
that can cure me completely
