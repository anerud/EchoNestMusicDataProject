Right now like a step outside
My heart beats genocide
Tearing out all the crippled walls
Drawing fire from the mortal flaws

To take it in on the chin, don't want to face it
We generate our debate to try to place it
Fear the eyes of the blind and the fallen
We cauterize as the dream comes crashing down

And like a poison will coerce you
To the very brink of salient pathologies
...
