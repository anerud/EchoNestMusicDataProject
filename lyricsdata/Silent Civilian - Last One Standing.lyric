You feed the lies they consume them
Impose a god will include them
Return the faith to impress him
Consequence, a contained life
Subject the mass to a coma
Sedating souls and conforming
Blinding them all without warning
Chosen one a vicious lie

The last one standing - is me

Deceiving lies of who you are
But I can see through you now
Perceiving not the ones you scar
...
