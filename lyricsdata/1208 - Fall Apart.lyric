Inside a storage bin
A pad-lock keeps me in
Emotions run low
If you've come for a show
I'm from the world today
Insane as some might say
Got nothing to show
If you've come just to send me away

I wasn't asking for it
And I tried to ignore it
I've got one problem
I fall apart for you
(I'm further from the truth)
A living disaster, I die for my master
It's true (I'm stuck and can't get loose)
Another example of losing my handle on you

I'm safe 'cause no one sees
What has become of me
Emotions run low
As my sickness just grows
