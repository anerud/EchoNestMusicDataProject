Hiya, Barbie!
Hi, Ken!
You wanna go for a ride?
Sure, Ken!
Jump in!

I'm a Barbie girl in a Barbie world
Life in plastic, it's fantastic
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation

Come on Barbie, let's go party!

I'm a Barbie girl in a Barbie world
Life in plastic, it's fantastic
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation

I'm a blond, bimbo girl, in a fantasy world
Dress me up, make me talk, I'm your dollie
(Ken)
You're my doll, rock'n'roll, feel the glamour and pain
Kiss me here, touch me there, hanky panky

You can touch, you can play
If you say, I'm always yours, oohoh

I'm a Barbie girl in a Barbie world
