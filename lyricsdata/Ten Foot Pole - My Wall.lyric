A middle class mom crouches on the hill
Eyes behind binoculars, she sits so still
Spots a boy going under the freeway
Whispers in her radio, going for the kill
Open your eyes! You're fighting kids
Who only want to make their mark
Everything else you took away
you left them in the dark
Open your eyes!
Your way is not about beauty
