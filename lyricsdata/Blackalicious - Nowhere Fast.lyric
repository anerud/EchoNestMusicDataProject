Sample (Scratched by Chief Xcel):

Now you, who ever you are,
as you're listening to what I'm going to say,
will probably not want to believe what I'm going to tell you.
And there isn't any way in which I can make you believe;
I can only state the facts as they are
and hope that you will really believe me.

[Gift of Gab]
Hey yester-day you were supposed to meet me now I got to testify
I waited hours for you guess that all was just a lie
Figured you stepped inside soon enough you said good bye
"Peace Out! I'm gone and won't be back!" I head your echo cry
Oh how the seconds fly left without a second try
I check and try to recollect how I just let you die
And now I wallow in these severed ties

Of Yesterday [woman's voice]

[Gift of Gab]
Of yester-day girl your really gone I guess that's how it just should be
I had big plans for us today but now you're history
Today's a mystery you took pieces I miss of me
I keep on diggin deep tryin to find that kid in me
We had some really good discussions back then didn't we?
Befriended me but now we don't speak like we're enemies
And all I got is memories

Of yesterday [woman's voice]

[Gift of Gab]
But Yester-day memories are priceless and I'm really glad you left em
There etched inside I take a ride when driftin through the spectrum
It's just at times I dwell and dwell and then I have to catch up
To now while back in time it ceased to march it just kept on
I want you back I want you back when it was here I slept on
What I appreciate a little more now as a blessing
Now I'm complaining and regretting

About yesterday [woman's voice]

And I'm just goin nowhere fast

CHORUS: woman's voice (repeat 2X)
I don't try to stay here
I just fly away here
Out of my oasis
I am not complacent
