You won't forget my eyes
Ooh, deep inside you realize
You're gonna see me
Wherever you go
You're gonna hear me
On your radio
There you are
In your car
And suddenly
You hear me
Do you want me
Do you want me

Take me to heart
I promise you a miracle
Take me to heart
You're gonna be mine
Take me to heart
You know it's just a matter of time
Whooo-oh-ooooooh-oh
