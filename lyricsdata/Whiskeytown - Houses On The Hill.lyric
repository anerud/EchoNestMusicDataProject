Well, I found a bunch of letters
They were written for the fellow
Who broke your momma's heart
And the envelope folds
Smelled of her ancient perfume

I'll bet she didn't know
How to respond to forty blankets of snow
Caught him out wandering alone
With no place to go

There were stars in the sky
There were houses on the hill
There were bottles and pills
That were easy to buy
