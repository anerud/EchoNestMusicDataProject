I lay here at night
Trying to shake the taste
Of marathon kisses, we used to share
Seems time can heal, the mess that we made
Though my heart reminisces when others appear oh

Shackled to the bed of past paradise
Nothing seems to be pleasing to my eyes
Ever since we ran out of words to say, oh yeah
Other kisses can no longer disguise
Desires to revisit past paradise
‘I love you’ is the picture I still portray
