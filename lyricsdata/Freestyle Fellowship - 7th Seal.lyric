Be advised they'll come
Be advised they'll come in
From a sky kingdom
Hear the trumpets ending
Be advised they'll come
From a black pure whirlwind
Be advised they'll come
Be advised they'll comeF

Running but Mecca sterile in the flames
Miracles never claim captive devious dubious doobies damn in hell
Forever jump back you crack rock heifer
Suffer heavy consequences in a harsh marsh environment
Bring a lyrical brack the bere intense to the bubble
Like plasma amoeba, placebo black rain fall
Sneering us all as I talk all
Now not knowing he had been betrayed
Bushwhacked and rattled in a hurry of slurry
Hurry don't worry, be afraid for your soul
Up, up, and away we go.

Be advised they'll come
Be advised they'll come in
The wink of an eye thin the sun
Shine no longer for anyone
Be advised they'll come
Some-what sure they'll win
Be advised they'll come
...
