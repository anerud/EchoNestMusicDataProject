This goes out to you!
This goes out to you!
And you, and you!
Late night tears
As well as fears
To give up now is like
Really wasting years
My friends say I need to
Leave to
Believe you, me
I would, but I can't
So it's back to square 1
But not like day 1 'cause
That day was fun
But as soon that I entered
I was lost like a key
To the door that slammed
Locked behind me.
Sometimes I hate it,
How can you have it without
Being reciprocated.
