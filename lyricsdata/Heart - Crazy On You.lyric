We may still have time, we might still get by
Every time I think about it, I want to cry
With the bombs and the devil and the kids keep coming
Nowhere to breathe easy, no time to be young

But I tell myself that I was doing alright
There's nothing left to do tonight

But go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, ohh

My love is the evening breeze touching your skin
The gentle, sweet singing of leaves in the wind
The whisper that calls after you in the night
And kisses your ear in the early moonlight
