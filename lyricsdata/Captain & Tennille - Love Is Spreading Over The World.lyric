The hills are alive and the earth is humming
Put your ear to the ground, you can hear it coming

Hear it in the trees as the breeze is blowing
See it in the fields where the grass is growing
Pretty soon, the world will be overflowing
With love, sweet love

Shout it down from the highest steeple
Give the word to all of god's people

Everybody's somebody's brother
Now is the time to love one another
Hand in hand we can make it together
...
