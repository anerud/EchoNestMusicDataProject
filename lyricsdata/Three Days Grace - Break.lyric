Tonight
My head is spinning
I need
Something to pick me up
I've tried
But nothin' is working
I won't stop
I won't say I've had enough
Tonight
I start the fire
Tonight
I break away

Break (break)
Away from everybody
Break (break)
Away from everything
If you can't stand
The way this place is
Take
Yourself to higher places
