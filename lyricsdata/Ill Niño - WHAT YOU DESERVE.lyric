Go!
It's too bad that you have made mistakes.
Too bad that I cannot relate.
When all else fails
When all else fades.
I kept my word through bitter days
(Through bitter days)
What you don't know. 
(Don't know)
Won't leave a scar.
What you don't know. 
(Don't know)
Hasn't killed you so far.
What you don't know. 
(Don't know)
Is who you are.
I just give you something to talk about.
What you don't know.
It's too late that now.
I've changed my mind.
