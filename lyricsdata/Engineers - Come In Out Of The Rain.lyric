I'm not to blame
No cracks in my shell so far
There is no shame
You're in the clear so far

'Cause you said it doesn't make it so
Doesn't mean that time stands still between us
There's nothing left to know
What you've stolen isn't really yours
Though your words, they have no meaning
Your awkwardness still shows

Ease it down
Come in out of the rain
To a better place
Sleaze is all you know
...
