Cryin' on the corner, waitin' in the rain
I swear I'll never, ever wait again
You gave me a word, but words for you are lies

Darlin', in my wildest dreams, I never thought I'd go
But it's time to let you know

I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna turn and leave you here

All of my life, I've been waitin' in the rain
I've been waitin' for a feeling that never, ever came
...
