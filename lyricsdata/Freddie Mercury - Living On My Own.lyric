Dee do de de, dee do de de

Sometimes I feel I'm gonna break down and cry (so lonely)
Nowhere to go, nothing to do with my time
I get lonely, so lonely, Living On My Own.
 
Sometimes I feel I'm always walking too fast (so lonely)
And everything is coming down on me, down on me, I go crazy
Oh so crazy - Living On My Own.
 
Dee do de de, dee do de de
