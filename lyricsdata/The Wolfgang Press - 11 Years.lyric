11 years of faking it
Same clothes, empty songs
Believing it like the most
Sing your blues and low life tunes
Make it sad, make it slow, make it wet like the honeymoon
Said to make it sentimental - lover man come slow and gentle

11 years - you kept me sunken
11 years - you kept me under
11 years

11 years of faking it
From art to junk and Motown passions
