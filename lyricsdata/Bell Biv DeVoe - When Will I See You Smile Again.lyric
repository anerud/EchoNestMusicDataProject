I'm so sorry, baby
I never meant to hurt you
Please forgive me

Tears, I see drop from your eyes
Tell me why you cry
Guilt, I feel when you look at me
Did I let you down?

Girl, you see that I
I apologize
Tell me what to do
To get through to you

Girl, it's not the same
I know I was to blame
Just tell me when will I
See you smile again?

Tell me when will I see you smile again?
'Cause I know I messed up, baby
And I know you're fed up, sugar

Tell me when will I see you smile again?
