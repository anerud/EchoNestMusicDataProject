Cold finger on the trigger
Behind the line drawn in the sand

Anger rise!
We fight a war
With much at stake
The rights of birth
That no one can take

Overflowing with anger
Soon to be awakening
Will be martyrs on to glory
Dawn finds us in this rage

My finger on the button
With what's so foreign in my sights
...
