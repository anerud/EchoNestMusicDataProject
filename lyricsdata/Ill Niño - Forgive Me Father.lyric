My despair
Sacred pages tell
What will happen
Fate will bring me there
I could never lead you
There is freedom to believe before the
Final prayer, final prayer, bring me there
There is no escape

(May god forgive me
I'm going to leave this world alone
Please forgive me
I'm going to turn you into stone
Please believe him
So you can hear me
No one will die on your cause
