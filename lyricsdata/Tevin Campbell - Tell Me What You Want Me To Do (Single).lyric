I love you girl
You called me up and I came to see you
You say you been awake all night
It hurts me deep inside when I see you cryin'
Whatever's wrong, I'll make it right

(*Bridge)
If you understand how I feel
You should know that my love is real

(*Chorus)
Tell me what you want me to do
My love is always here for you
Tell me what you want me to do
My love is always here for you
So tell me what you want me to do
