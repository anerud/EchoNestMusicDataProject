(Verse 1)
Somebody play on the guitar stings
Makes me think of my favorite songs
Reminds me of when I heard Aretha sang
Gladys, Steven, and Chaka Khan
Can't go back to yesterday
Can we just put the thongs away

(Bridge)
And fall back in love with music
Nothin' but the music
Oh

Everybody knows that Marvin's gone
