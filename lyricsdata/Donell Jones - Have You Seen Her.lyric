Well, well, well, well, well
Hmm, whoa
Check it out

Sitting at the light she pulled up on my right
Looking in the mirror making sure her shit was tight
I know she felt me watching but was scared to look my way
I know she wants to look, but I think I got her shook

Under pressure, don't know what to do
She's got two cuties with her and I got my peoples too
She put it in one, stepped on the gun, and made a U
Looked inside, gave me a smile, then she blew, what am I gonna do

Tell me, which way did she go
Pretty young thing in a GS4
Love was so bangin' had me open from the door
Tell me, have you seen her?

She had a smile that I couldn't forget
Shinning brighter than the floss piece around her neck
The girl was so fine I just gotta make her mine
Tell me, have you seen her? Have you seen her?
