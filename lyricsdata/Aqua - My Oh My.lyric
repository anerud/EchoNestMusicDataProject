My oh my do you wanna say goodbye?
To half their Kingdom, baby, tell me why?
My oh my do you wanna say goodbye?
To rule a country, baby, you and I?

If you were my King...

My oh my do you wanna say goodbye?
To half the Kingdom, baby, tell me why?
My oh my do you wanna say goodbye?
To rule a country, baby, you and I?

A little princess in a terrible mess,
a kingdom alone, with no lovers confess,
dreams of a prince on a tall white horse,
runs like a spirit by the castle walls.

Gotta steal from the rich, when they don't know I'm coming,
gotta give to the poor, no time for lovin'
My oh my don't you cry, 'cause there is no way I'm staying,
I will leave say "bye bye", I'm going my way...

My oh my do you wanna say goodbye?
...
