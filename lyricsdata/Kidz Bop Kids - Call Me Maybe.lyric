I threw a wish in the well. Don't ask me i'll never tell. I looked to you as it fell. And now your in my way. I trade my soul for a wish. Pennies and dimes for a kiss. I wasn't looking for this. And know your in my way. Your stare was holding. Ripped jeans smile was showing. Hot night wind was blowing. Where do you think you're going baby?
