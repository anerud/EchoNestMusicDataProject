I was never the kind
To be taking my time
Any place that's worth a damn
And today's another day
That I've gone and thrown away
And I don't care where it lands

'Cause I'm just thinking about us
I've been living in a dream about you
And now I know you were all I ever wanted on my mind
And if I never see
My own reality
Well, I'm okay to leave it all behind
