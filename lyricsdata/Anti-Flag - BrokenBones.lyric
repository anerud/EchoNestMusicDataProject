Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin' the life

Close my eyes try to make it last
Outrun the wretched memories of my past
It moves too fast
I got no chance
A freight train racing set to crash

Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin' the life
Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin' the life
