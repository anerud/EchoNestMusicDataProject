The clock is ticking on the wall
the world is spinning
while the millions work to justify there lives
they search for meaning
in their useless sense of breeding

when they die

but ego won't permit
belief in our mortality
so we manufactured our delusioned lie
we believe with much conviction
in our useless superstition
that our lives are bigger than life
