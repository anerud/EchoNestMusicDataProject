If I could give you the world
On a silver platter
Would it even matter
You'd still be mad at me

If I could find in all this
A dozen roses
Which I would give to you
You'd still be miserable

In reality
I'm gone be who I be
And I don't feel no fault
For all the lies that you bought
You can try as you may
Break me down but I say
That it ain't up to you
Gone and do what you do

Hate on me hater
Now or later
Cuz I'm gonna do me
You'll be mad baby (go head and hate)
Go head and hate on me hater
I'm not afraid of
What I gotta to pay for
You can hate on me

Ooh if I gave you peaches
Out my own garden
And I made you a peach pie
