Things never seem to go according to plans
so we always end up compromising,
we're not smart enough to have a plan B at hand
so we always end up improvising,
it's killing us to settle with the cards we get
when we know there's much more at stake,
but giving in to pressure is the safest bet
& it's also our biggest mistake.

That's the price we pay, that's the price we pay
That's the price we pay, that's the price we pay
...
