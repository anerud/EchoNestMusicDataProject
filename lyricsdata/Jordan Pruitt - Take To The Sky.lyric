All of your life you've been waiting
Keeping your feet on the ground
So much that you've never seen
It's just been a dream and until now

Everyone knows it's your moment
The magic you need is in sight
So go out and follow your heart
Make all your dreams come to life

Take to the sky and fly through the heavens
Open your eyes and soar above the blue
