Superstition, fear, and jealousy

Dead I am the one
Exterminating son
Slipping through the trees
Strangling the breeze
Dead I am the sky
Watching angels cry
While they slowly turn
Conquering the worm

Dig through the ditches and burn through the witches
I slam in the back of my Dragula
Dig through the ditches and burn through the witches
I slam in the back of my Dragula

Dead I am the pool
Spreading from the fool
Weak and want you need
