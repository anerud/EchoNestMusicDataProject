Take your baby by the hand
And make her do a high hand stand
And take your baby by the heel
And do the next thing that you feel

We were so in phase in our dance hall days
We were cool on craze
When I, you and everyone, we knew
Could believe, do and share in what was true

I said, Dance hall days love

Take your baby by the hair
And pull her close and there there there
And take your baby by the ears
And play upon her darkest fears
