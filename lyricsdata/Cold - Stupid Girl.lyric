Wanna love ya
Wanna bug ya
Wanna squeeze ya
Stupid girl

Wanna touch ya
Wanna take ya
Wanna shut ya
Stupid girl

I can't take this
Born to break this

She's going away (she's going away)
What's wrong with my life today
She's going away (she's going away)
What's wrong with my life today

Stupid girl
Stupid girl
