Midnight, it's raining outside, he must be soaking wet
Everyone is sleeping tight, God knows I tried my best
Darling, you know it looks bad
Just lost the best thing that I ever had, well
Still I don't know why I did him wrong, no
It's too late, now, he's gone to say

CHORUS
Baby, oh, no, can't leave me now
Said, think about it, please
'Cause I love you, and I need you
And I should have thought of that before I did you wrong, yeah
Before I did you wrong
I should have thought of that
Oo, before I did you wrong

Heartache, heartache, yeah
When I saw his face I could see how bad I'd let him down
Cheating when he was working hard, I just had to mess around
I knew from the start he ain't got much money
