Close your eyes
Give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating?
Do you understand?
Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Is this burning?
An eternal flame

I believe

I watch you when you are sleeping
You belong with me
Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Or is this burning?
An eternal flame

Say my name
