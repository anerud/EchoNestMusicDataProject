Wake up and rise to live another day
Put on your gloves to fight society
Tuck in your fears and build your train of thought
Stand up for your beliefs and never stop
(Oh!)

Pushing hard each day
Keep our individuality
Elavate your mind
Strength within is what you need to find

Pick up the pieces, we all make mistakes
Rebirth of selfesteem, ignore what's fake
