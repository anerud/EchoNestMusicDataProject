I was there to witness
Candice’s inner princess
She wants the boys to notice
Her rainbows, and her ponnies
She was educated
But could not count to ten
How she got lots of different horses
By lots of different men

And I say
Liberate your sons and daughters
The bush is high
But in the hole there’s water
You can get some, when they give it
Nothing sacred, but it's a living

Hey ho here she goes
Either a little too high or a little too low
Got no self-esteem and vertigo
Cause she thinks she’s made of candy

Hey ho here she goes
Either a little too loud or a little too close
There's a hurricane in the back of her throat
And she thinks she’s made of candy

Ring a ring of roses
Whoever gets the closest
She comes and she goes
As the war of the roses
...
