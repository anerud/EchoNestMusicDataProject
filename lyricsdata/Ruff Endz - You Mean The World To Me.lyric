Ooh, listen girl
It's plain to see that you're the one
Every moment I'm around you, I fall
Cause everything you say and do
It always comes straight from the heart
And there's no mistaking
You make me the best I can be
They can keep the stars and mountains and seas

1 - You are the world to me
You are the world to me
For all the rest of my life
