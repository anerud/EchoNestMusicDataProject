Sweetheart, I’ve been tryin’ so hard to get over you
Just simply can’t
‘Cause the love we shared through the years
Meant so much to me
All I’m lookin’ for is just a serious relationship
Someone I can hold all my life
Why don’t you give me that commitment

Let’s settle down
Let’s chill
Don’t be afraid of me
I know my love is scarin' you
But I promise everything will be alright
Come closer
Let me talk to you

Let’s chill
(Ho, ho, baby, hey... hey... ya.)
Let’s chill
(Let’s chill, baby)

From the first time I saw your face
Girl I knew I had to have you
I wanted to wrap you with my warm embrace
Visions of your lovely face

All my love is for you
Whatever you want I will do
You’re the only one I want in my life
...
