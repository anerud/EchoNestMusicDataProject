Rakim the microphone soloist

Follow procedures the crowd couldn't wait to see this
Nobody been this long awaited since Jesus
Who wouldn't believe this I heard the word on the street is
I'm still one of the deepest on the mic since Adidas

They said I changed the times from the rhymes that I thought of
So I made some more to put the New World in Order
With Mathematics, put your status above the average
And help you rappers, make paragraphs with graphics

'Cause new days is dawnin', new ways of peformin'
Brain stormin', I write and watch the night turn to mornin'
On and on and, I got the whole world respondin'
Rock, I keep it hot and blow the spot without warnin'

The Emperor, well known for, inventin' a sentence
Full of adventure, turnin' up the temperature
Rush with adrenaline, how long has it been again
To be in the state of min'd that Rakim is in?

Rakim, the microphone soloist
