Huh!

There is no love
No Love

Huh!

I am a duplication
Innocently
I was conceived
So violently

There was no love
There was no love for me
There was only hatred

I am rape
I am hate
I am rape
I am hate

Every day I feel anonymous hate
Forever in the shadow of disgrace

I am rape
I am hate
I am rape
...
