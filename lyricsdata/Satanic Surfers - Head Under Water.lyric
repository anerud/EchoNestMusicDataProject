I can't stand your stupid ugly face,
In combination with 
Your John Wayne cowboy boots
After every time that I have met you,
I have to clean my ears
From all the shit that you have spoken.

And I'm happy i don't live on your block
So i don't have to see you every day.

And now that you know
Why don't you stay the fuck away from me
