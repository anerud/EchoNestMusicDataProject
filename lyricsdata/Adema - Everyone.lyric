I'm sick of the excuses that you want me to believe
I've been understanding
Giving everything you need
Using me is over now and soon you're gonna see
I'm done with you

Would there be a difference if I followed what you say
Taken from my mind and I can't seem to get away
Using me is over now and soon you're gonna see
I'm done with you

Everyone is the same
