In an open room that echoes well
This is where I can tell you everything
Ba da da

This is where I meet my muse
And it feeds me
And this is how I buy the sun
And it feeds me

This is why I burn this candle
I light it so that I can handle this

And you're so still, and you're, you're so safe
And you appear severe, you are so nonchalant
...
