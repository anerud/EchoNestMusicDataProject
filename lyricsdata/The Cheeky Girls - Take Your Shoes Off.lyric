Woo
Cheeky Girls
Just Do It
Just Do It
Every girl and boy needs to grow up
To enjoy the fun in disco clubs
It is hard to be under 18
You can push the time to be just free
Shake your body feel the beat
Take your shoes off and feel free
We love our teenage lives
Disco fever never dies

5-4-3-2-1

Shake it, shake it
Shake it, Shake it
Move it, Move it
Move it, Move it
Take your shoes off
And feel
the freedom
