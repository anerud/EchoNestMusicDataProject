Bless me with patience
Throw forth with all your strength to me
And lend me your hand. In this hour take me safely
For my time is near
I look down upon this empty land
It's like crystal here
So warm, so pure, so calm, so clear
As we take the path
We shudder inside. No turning back
Have we gone to far
