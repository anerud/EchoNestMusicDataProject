Walked down the sidewalk
Staring at your feet
Wishing my steps were longer
So by your sides I could keep

Hold your hand much bigger
Never wanted mine to grow
So I could always feel perfect
Inside your palms just so

No one loves me just like you do
No one knows me just like you do
No one can compare to way my eyes fit in yours
You'll always be my father
And I'll always be your joy
