I have often dreamed, of a far off place,
Where a hero's welcome, would be waiting for me,
Where the crowds will cheer, when they see my face,
And a voice keeps saying, "this is where I'm meant to be."

I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
I will find my way, if I can be strong,
I know every mile, will be worth my while,
When I go the distance I'll be right where I belong.
