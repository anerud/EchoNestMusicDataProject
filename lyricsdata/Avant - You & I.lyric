Yea, I just want yall to get up on this one
Its goin down real big tonight
She dipped in tha club
Baby walk was mean
Way that ass move
In them Cavalli jeans
Manolo heal, coat, and bag too
She was flickin fo sho
And her whole crew
I said

[Chorus]
Step ova here into mah booth
Pop that Crystal, pour that Gray Goose
Turn tha track up its bout ta get loose
