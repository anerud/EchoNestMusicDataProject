She says your money's safe
You needn't keep your head down
Who's kidding who?
Her picture's all over town

I read the paper and it said so
I know you like them to be troublesome
Take it to the maximum

She likes to go for the jugular
Murderess, murderer
That woman of yours is a killer

I heard his breath escape
She left the gun on the floor
He left his key with me
