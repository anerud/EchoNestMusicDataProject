(Intro)
This is a song that makes me spill out all my guts
Sometimes

Sometimes, I wish I wasn't me
Sometimes, I wish I was drug free
Sometimes, wish I saw the exit sign first
Sometimes, wish I knew the truth without search
Sometimes, I wish I could go where I never been
See what I never saw, do what I never did
Or walk before I could crawl

Sometimes, I wish my eyes wasn't so red
Sometimes, I wish I had breakfast in bed
Sometimes, I mean it's worth it
Since I did all the work last night
Sometimes, you ain't good to me, yes
I am good to you
And you don't see my attention the way that I do

Sometimes, hey slim, you should be nicer than you are
Sometimes, you take that complaining shit way too far
I mean, I thought it was cute in the beginning but now
