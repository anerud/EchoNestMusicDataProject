When i think of home
i think of a resting place
a place where theres peace, quiet, and serenity
and thats where some of my friends have gone
friends who have traveled with me through my wonderful experience in oz
a journey ill never forget
When i think of home, i think of a place
wheres theres love overflowing
i wish i was home, i wish i was back there
with the things ive been knowing
Wind that makes the tall grass bend into leaning
suddenly the raindrops that fall they have a meaning
sprinklin the scene
makes it all clean
(when i think of home)
maybe theres a chance for me to go back
now that i have some direction
(maybe theres a chance ill get home)
it sure would be nice to be back at home
where theres love and affection
...
