Set me free why don't cha, baby
Get out of my life why don't cha, baby
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on

Set me free why don't cha, baby
Get out of my life why don't cha, baby
You don't really need me
But you keep me hangin' on

Why do you keep a comin' around
Playing with my heart
Why don't cha get out of my life
And let me make a brand new start
Let me get over you
