Promises you made me
All the things you told me
You said you'd never leave me
We'll be together for eternity
Now it's all in the past
Now I know our love will last
Lady I will do all I can
Lady I would be all I am

(Pre-Chorus)
I'll give you all you've had before
So come on in and close the door
Let me show you what I could be
Could you just please tell me
