My love, do you ever dream of
Candy coated raindrops?
You're the same, my candy rain

Have you ever loved someone
So much you thought you'd die?
Giving so much of yourself

Tell me what you want and I
And I will give it to you
'Cause you are

My love, do you ever dream of
Candy coated raindrops?
You're the same, my candy rain
