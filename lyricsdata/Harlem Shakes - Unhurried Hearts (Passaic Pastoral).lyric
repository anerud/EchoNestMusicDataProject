We'd meet at midday in my bedroom
A DVD of fade to black
The sun won't rest till we both undress
And rug burns bloom on our backs
Then we'd forage at the farmer's market
And dine on dirty fruit
The sun won't rest till we all face west
And sirens turn to flutes

Why can't we have unhurried hearts
...
