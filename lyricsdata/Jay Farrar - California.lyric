Walked the sidewalks of San Francisco.
Spent the night in a town called Weed.
Soaked up the sun on Mission Street.
Filled up the day in Chinatown.

It's been said before,
But it's worth saying,
No one could dream a place like California.
It's written before,
But it's worth repeating,
No one could dream a place like California.
