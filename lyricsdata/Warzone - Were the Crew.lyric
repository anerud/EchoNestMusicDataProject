Thought it was cool to hang out
Way back when
You've changed your ways since then
You got new friends
Don't need me anymore
Your new friends won't take your back
When your head's to the floor

The new crew is stronger than ever before
Kids with strong hearts and minds of their own
Maybe it's better you're not part of your crew
Cause we don't need no more mindless negative fools like you
