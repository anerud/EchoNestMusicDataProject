Don't want to be a part of this institution

Want to rip it, I can't take it
I throw a fist in this institution
Too many lies are sold for nothing
Independent, start the movement
We want to start our own revolution
You can take these rules and shove it
(You can take these rules and shove it)
We won't conform to be accepted
(I won't be conformed accepted)
Suffered too long desperate for a change

You and I stand, united
...
