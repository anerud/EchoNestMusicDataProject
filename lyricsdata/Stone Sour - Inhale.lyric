Come one and all and see the broken man
Talking to himself
He sits and waits for something better
He'll never find it here
The people touch his hair and pinch his cheek
He can't even feel it

There it goes again
He's listening to someone
He hears the bitter laughter
And all he wants to know is...

Why does any of it matter?
(I can't take it anymore)
You've gotta try
The inhale that makes the exhale so much better
...
