You said, I was your everything
You said, I was the one
You played me like a radio
You used to love that I had no shame

Put my pain into words
Hold my hand to the flame

Tell me you'll love me like a star
Tell me you want me wherever you are
Tell me you'll breathe me till your last breath

Liar, liar
Oh, liar, liar
