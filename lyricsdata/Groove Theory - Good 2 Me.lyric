Are you, are you, are you, are you
Are you, are you gonna be

Are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be

Baby, we're so fly together
We could touch the clouds
If we go, I wanna know
Will you catch me when I come down

Limit is the sky if you can look me in the eye
And without any doubt, say you'll never lie

(Are you gonna be)
Good 2 me
(Are you gonna be)
Everything
(Are you gonna be)
All I need

(Are you gonna be)
Good 2 me
(Are you gonna be)
Faithfully
Good 2 me

My words are the questions to the answers
You behold, you could lie or you could try
To make them good as gold
And my heart is the place that you could
One day call your home
If you can't be a man, just leave me alone

If life should let me down
Will you be around
To lift me off the ground
Will you be around
