Johnny played guitar, Jenny played bass.
Name of the band is The Human Race.
Everybody tell me have you heard? Pop goes the world.

Jenny played keyboard, Johnny played drums,
Called Little Baby and a big Bonhomme
Everybody tell me have you heard? Pop Goes The World.

It goes something like this: (p p p pop)

Johnny and Jenny had a crazy dream,
See their pictures in a magazine.
Every little boy needs a girl.
Pop Goes The World.
