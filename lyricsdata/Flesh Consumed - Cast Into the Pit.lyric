Beneath the septic system of the metropolis*
Hides a lair of torment and killing
An assembly of intertwining tunnels and passages
The underground labyrinth leads into a pit
Chloroform on a rag, I drag victims into the feeding ground
Awakened by the bestial gutturals of starved boars
The gates are drawn and the beasts are released into the labyrinth
