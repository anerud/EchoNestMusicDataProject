It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since u took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since u took your love away
Since u been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing
nothing can take away these blues
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares 2 u

It's been so lonely without u here
