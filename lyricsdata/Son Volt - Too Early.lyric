Mileage has taken its toll
Paid it with lines to show
You've had your fill of asphalt
Cough tremors, and smoke-filled doors

Look like the habit controls you
You look like you need a rest
You've made it to the timber-line
Don't know what to expect

God knows, you don't need it
Too early, you might be the one
**YOU To find yourself somewhere else
Too early in the sun
