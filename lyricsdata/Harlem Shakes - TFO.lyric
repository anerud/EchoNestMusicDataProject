You say I'm blind and deaf and fun
my gamesomeness a loaded gun
you guard your nerves, like they're your sons
say that you've been burned before
well you and me can burn some more
we'll fight fire with fire but without a fight
we can swim in this coney island ocean
all gray and thick tonight

Reel in
your feelins
...
