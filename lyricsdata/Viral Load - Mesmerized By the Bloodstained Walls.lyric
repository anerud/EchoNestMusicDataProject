Contemplating thoughts of genocide
Formulating ways for man's demise
Scientific methods will be used
To eradicate this world of filth
Running will not help you to escape
Fighting back will only seat your fate
The sins you have committed you must pay
Forever you will be my fucking slave
Strapped unto the table now you are mine
Smiling with glee as your blood
starts to spill
