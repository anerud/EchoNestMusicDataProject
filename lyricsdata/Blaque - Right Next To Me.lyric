Intro:
What's up baby
it's me and
my plane leaves Kenya in the morning
I wanted to see you before I left
but you are not home so (ohhh)
well I, this is pretty much my big break
wish me luck
and umm
I want u to know
that no matter where I am
or what I am doing
I'll always love you
bye bye

Verse 1:
Goodbye
it's time for me to go
I'll call you in the morning
So I can pack and go
The way you really feel boy
put your mind at ease
I don't
