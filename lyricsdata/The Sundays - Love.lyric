Picture myself as a thin white child
Back to the day I was born on
They slapped me into line as it crossed my mind
I've felt better
I've felt worse

This is my life and it's all very well
But never again
As they say "We've been robbed"
And don't you know that this time

Love, just love yourself like no one else
Love, it's enough
They can say what they like but they still can't take that
