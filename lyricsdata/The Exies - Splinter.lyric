I know what it feels like
It burns from the inside
I know what that hurts like
'Cause I've been wrong a thousand times
My bones are all cracked
Splinter deep in my back
I'm still the same but we have changed
And now I have to live with my mistakes
Will I ever learn

I'm battered and bruised
Scratched on the inside
I'm losing myself
I'm so sick of the lies
Dead ring in my ears
The hole underneath
You're deep in my skin
...
