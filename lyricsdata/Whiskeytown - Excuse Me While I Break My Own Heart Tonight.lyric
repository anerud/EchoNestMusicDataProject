One, two, three, four.

Well excuse me if I break my own heart
It's mine from the finish I guess
It was mine from the start
This situation just don't seem so goddamn smart
This situation is tearing me apart

So you'll have to excuse me
I break my own heart

Well excuse me if I break my own heart tonight
Some things aren't born too strong
