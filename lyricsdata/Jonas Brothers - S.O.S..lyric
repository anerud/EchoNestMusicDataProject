Told you I made dinner plans
For you and me and no one else
That don't include your crazy friends
Well, I'm done with awkward situations
Empty conversations
Ooh, this is an S.O.S.
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line
It's true I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walkin' on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get
So this is where the story ends
