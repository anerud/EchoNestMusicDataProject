Everybody saying we gotta take a chance
And telling me what the hell went wrong
We only listen to the words that we sing
Now a million are singing along

(Last one)
We got it right, you got wrong,
We're still around (Last one to die)
We're going up, you're going down
We're still around (Last one to die)

NO RULES IN A
SCANDALOUS WORLD
... a path to find
...
