I remembered almost nothing
From when I was a kid
That felt strange when others talked about their
Childhood memories
Warm and tender
They remember
Never thought much about it
But now that it is gone
The house that I grew up in
Gave me back my memories
Warm and tender
I remember sweet memories
Long forgotten
