I walk on ice, I play with fire
For loving you, baby, I'd dance on wire
Oh, I can't sleep at night
Loving you, I'd pay that price
Loving you is like walking on ice

Walking on ice
Walking on ice
Walking on ice

Who broke you down, who's there to blame
Who tore you up inside and left the pain
Oh, someone burned your life
