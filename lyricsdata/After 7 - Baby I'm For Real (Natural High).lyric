Baby, baby, you don't understand
How much I love you, baby
How much I wanna be your only man
And baby, baby, baby, you don't have to go
Stay a little while longer, I wanna talk to you just a little more
I see the little tears in your eyes, about to fall
You are wondering if I'm for real
But if you cry, I wonder why you cry
I tell you no lie, this how I feel
Oh, baby I'm for real
Do do do do do do
Do do do ooh
Baby, baby, baby, you don't have to go
