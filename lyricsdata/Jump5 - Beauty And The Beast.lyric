Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Than somebody bends
Unexpectedly

Just a little change (ho, ho)
Small, to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast

Ever just the same
(In your eyes I am beautiful)
Ever a surprise
(A love like this is a miracle)
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise

Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong

Certain as the sun (ho, ho)
Rising in the east
...
