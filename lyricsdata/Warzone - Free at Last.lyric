I found it years ago
Trying to find it again
But if I fail, I wont let it be the end
I hear people say they have no faith in me
Drink their alcohol smoke that dust
Talk about me and their lives are fucked
Time has come to do what's right
Don't want to live dead and lose the fight
Free at last- from the drugs I crave
Free at last- from
alcohol's daze
Free at last- from that P.C.P.
Free at last- from insanity
