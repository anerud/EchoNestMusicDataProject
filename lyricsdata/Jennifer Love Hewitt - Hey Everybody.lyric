We've all got troubles, we all make mistakes
Well let's not take a little river turn it into lake
We've all been humble, we've lost and we've found
But it can never get the best of us if we're not looking down

And I wonder, are there others like me
Yeah I wonder
I've got the whole world left to see

Hey everybody, if you listen to the beat
We'll celebrate it now by stompin' our feet
Hey everybody, do you know what I mean
We can get it dirty while we're keeping it clean

Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na

You got it bad well she's got it worse
She's got no chocolate in the bank account, no cheese in the purse
You're feel neglected with no self-esteem
Just when you finally found you're glitter someone's taken the gleam

When you wonder why is life always this way
Yes you wonder
