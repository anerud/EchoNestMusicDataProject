The governments say that it's what we need
To work until we die, serving someone else's greed
They separate, divide, but it's the same red blood we bleed
Rob us the fruit but we'll always have the seed

So people are speaking out against what they see
Searching for the truth within the promises of liberty
People are imprisoned for what they believe
Or is it just propaganda?

Out of the gate, we're all quick to defend
The sellout positions, white-washed of content
To our heart's discontent
To our heart's discontent

Too afraid of our failures
Faith and future unknown
