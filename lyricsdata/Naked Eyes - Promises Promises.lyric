Never had a doubt in the beginning
Never a doubt
Trusted you true in the beginning
I loved you right through

Arm in arm we laughed like kids
At all the silly things we did

You made me promises, promises
Knowing I'd believe
Promises, promises
You knew you'd never keep

Second time around, I'm still believing
The words that you said
You said you'd always be here
