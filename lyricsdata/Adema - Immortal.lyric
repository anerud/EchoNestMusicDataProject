Let's fight

We're face to face
Loyalty is what I need to see from you
You're insecure
I can see the fear that breeds in your heart

Where will you run
Where will you hide
I see the blood
Drip from your eyes
Who will survive
Let's get it on
And we'll fight

I know who you are
The leader of lost souls
You can't kill me
I'm immortal
I'm not afraid to die
My soul will travel on

You can't kill me
I'm immortal
