You're given two sets of clues
With the answers all the same
And a two-speed crossword
Called 'Love in the suds'

Your bullet holes are screaming
Wearing shoes you should be seen in
With a brave knife and fork
We're all set to go flying

Comes trouble

Here comes trouble

Your thought for the weeks
In the river, river, river
Feels something like a crow
Flying 'round with the planes
