There's me
Looking down at my shoes
The one smiling like the sun
That's you
What were you thinking
What was the song inside your head
There's us
Going on about a band
Working out how we play our hand
I lay there dreaming
Later all alone in my bed

If I was stupid
Maybe careless
So were you

Not everything is supposed to come true
Some words are best unsaid
Some love is not really love at all
