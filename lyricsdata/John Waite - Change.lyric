People talking
And they're saying that you're leaving
You're so unhappy
With the way that you've been living

Oh-oh-oh, we always wish for money
We always wish for fame
We think we have the answers
Some things ain't ever gonna change (Change)
It doesn't matter who you are
It's all the same
What's in your heart will never change

Look in the mirror
And you see how you've been taken
Ooh, you won't surrender
But now your heart is breakin'
