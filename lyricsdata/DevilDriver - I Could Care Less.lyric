Every time you speak my name
My image it just burns away
Every time you speak my name
My image it just burns away

Gimme that

I could care less than for your grandiosity
I had to skin the cat for curiosity
I could care less than for your sickening, pompous ways
Every time you speak my name my image burns away

I could care less
I could care less
I could care less
I could care less

Don't you know our lives are on trial now
