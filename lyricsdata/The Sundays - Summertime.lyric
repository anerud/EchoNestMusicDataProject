Do some people wind up with the one that they adore
In a heart shaped hotel room, it's what a heart is for
The bubble floats so madly will it stay sky high?
Hello partner, kiss your name bye bye
Sometimes

Romantic Piscean seeks angel in disguise
Chinese speaking girlfriend, big brown eyes
Liverpudlian lady, sophisticated male
Hello partner, tell me love can't fail

And it's you and me in the summertime
We'll be hand in hand down in the park
With a squeeze and a sigh and that twinkle in your eye
...
