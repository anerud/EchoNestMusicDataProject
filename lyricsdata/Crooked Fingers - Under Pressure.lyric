Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man ask for
Under pressure - that burns a building down, splits a
family in two
Puts people on streets

That's OK
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming "Let me out!"
Pray tomorrow - gets me higher
Pressure on people - people on streets
Chippin around - kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
...
