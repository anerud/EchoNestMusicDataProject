Well I'm standing here looking at you
What do I see? I'm looking straight through
It's so sad when you're young
To be told you're having fun

So unplug the jukebox and do us all a favor
That music's lost it's taste so try another flavor
Antmusic, antmusic, antmusic, antmusic

Well I'm standing here what do I see?
A big nothing threatening me
It's so sad when you're young
To be told you're having fun
...
