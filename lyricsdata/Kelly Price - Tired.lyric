There's a hole in my heart
My soul is bleeding
I need to free my mind
And see what I'm feelin'

'Cause lord knows
Lord knows

Tired, tired of the way he treats me
Tired, tired of the guilty feelings
Tired, tired of the broken dreams
I'm tired, tired of the public scenes

I'm tired, tired of the baby mamas
Tired, tired of the ghetto dramas
Tired, tired of the back and forth
...
