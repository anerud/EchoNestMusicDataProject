I love you whether or not you love me
I love you even if you think that I don't
Sometimes I find you doubt my love for you
But I don't mind
Why should I mind
Why should I mind

What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway
What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway

Can anybody love anyone so much that they will never fear
Never worry never be sad
