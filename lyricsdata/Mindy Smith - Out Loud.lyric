Hey friend why are we always hiding
It's no wonder that we're sinking down
Why should we stand in lonely shadows
With so much light around

Hey friend why are we always crying
So many tears are gonna dry us out
Whatever they're selling we've gotta stop buying
'Cause our pockets are empty now

I've thought about
And I've prayed about it
Out loud, out loud
We can talk about it
...
