I've seen better days, dripping down your face
We don't have to talk, let's dance
For all the times you felt alone, dreaming better
I see better, better days
Too dumb to say goodbye that's some cliché shit, make me wanna cry
Just know that every time I look in your eye, I see better, I see better, better days

Try to remember, that you can't forget
Down with history, up with your head
