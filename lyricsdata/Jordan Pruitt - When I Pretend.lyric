Thoughts of you keep running through my head
Images I just want to forget
I. look in the mirror and put on a happy face
But nobody sees it
And I don't believe it

I. bought into every word you said
I never thought it's something I'd regret
I look at you now and wonder who I see
I'm lost in a frenzy
And it's neverending

The way we used to talk all night
I still get butterflies
When I go there again
Oh I see the way you used to smile
...
