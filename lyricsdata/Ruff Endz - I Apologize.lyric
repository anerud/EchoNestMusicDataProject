What is he doing now? Baby, listen.

Take a look in the mirror, baby,
And I promise you, you'll see what I see.
The most beautiful thing, heaven and earth,
Both adore you, now,
So don't change the way you are,
And don't change the things you do.
All because of one man was untrue to you,
And one day, he's gonna realize,
That he gave up a jewel when he gave up you.

He was wrong girl, and he knows it,
But he just won't admit it,
So for every single time that he made you cry,
I apologize, I apologize.
He was wrong girl, and he knows it,
But he just won't admit it,
So for every single time that he told you lies,
I apologize, I apologize.
