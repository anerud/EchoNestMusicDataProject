My mind's telling me no
But my body, my body's telling me yes
Baby - I don't wanna hurt nobody
But there is something, that I must confess - to you

[Chorus]
(I don't see nothing wrong) ooh…
(With a little bump, and grind) with a little bump, and grind
(I don't see nothing wrong) ba-baby - hey, I
(I don't see nothing wrong) I don't see nothing wrong
(With a little bump, and grind) with a little bump, and grind
(I don't see nothing wrong) hey, ooh…ooh

(Lookie here)
See I know, just what you want
And I know, just what you need girl
