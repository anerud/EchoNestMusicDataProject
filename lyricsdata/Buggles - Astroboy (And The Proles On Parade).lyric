All of those wild American bilinguals
Who'll talk to you in Paris of their lonely lives
School days and last days out there in the Midwest
They climb on the liners to rejoin their wives

Walking down boulevards electric eyes
Would gaze at the waveforms and gasp at their size
Let them be lonely and say you don't care

Astroboy... [(I'm watching the proles on parade)]
