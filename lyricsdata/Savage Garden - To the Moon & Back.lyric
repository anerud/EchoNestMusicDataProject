And daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from human affection
But somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot
To come (and she'll say to him)
She's saying

I would fly you to the moon and back
If you'll be if you'll be my baby
Got a ticket for a world where

So would you be my baby
Ooh-ooh

She can't remember a time
When she felt needed
