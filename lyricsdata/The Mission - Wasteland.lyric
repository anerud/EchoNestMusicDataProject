There's a crystal view from my window
And I can see years to come
I live for the burn and the sting of pleasure
I live for the sword, the steel, and the gun
I can tear down the walls, storm the barricades
Run to the place where the frightened crawl
Desire lurks beyond good and evil
So dance on the graves where the hallowed fall

Over this land
All over this wasteland
Over this land
...
