I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go
Walkin' with a dead man
I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go
Walkin' with a dead man over my shoulder
Don't run away it's only me

Waiting for an invitation to arrive
Goin' to a party where no one's still alive
Waiting for an invitation to arrive
Goin' to a party where no one's still alive

I was struck by lighting, walkin' down the street
I was hit by something last night in my sleep
It's a dead man's party who could ask for more
Everybody's comin', leave your body at the door
Leave your body and soul at the door

Don't run away it's only me
Only me, only me
