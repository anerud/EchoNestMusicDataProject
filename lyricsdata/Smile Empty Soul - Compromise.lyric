Drive through your neighborhood
You hide like I knew you would
You don't ever call me
You told me to stay away
A game that you always play
But i know that you want me

And I'm staring at the walls again
With these pictures that are in my head

When will you realize
Now you're forever mine, you don't have to run
I won't compromise
...
