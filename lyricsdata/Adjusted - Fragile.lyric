What do you want out of life?
Satisfaction for your fragile mind.
Well it seems you're stuck between, 
The things you want and things you need... 
Well... 

When another day goes by and you let it go to waste.
Do you feel that you've done all you can?
Are you convinced that you'll be fine, 
That everything will be alright?
It never seemed to matter much to you.
