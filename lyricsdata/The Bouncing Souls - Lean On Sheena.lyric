Did you intimidate her?
Her mother says you wouldn't let her use the phone
Or were you intoxicated
passed the point of knowing what was going on

better yet, don't forget, leave the keys on the t.v. set
hoping your gone for the corner bar
here we are after dark
knocking back the makers mark
scrounging up the dollars from my buddy's car
and

lean on sheena
she leans on me a lot
hold on, hold on, hold on to what you've got

intimidate her
how'd you make her feel?
worse than she did before

and i heard you
came back later
...
