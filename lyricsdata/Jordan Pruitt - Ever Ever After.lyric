Storybook endings
Fairytales coming true
Deep down inside
We wanna believe
They still do
And a secret is taught
It's our favorite part
Of the story
Let's just admit
We all wanna make it to

Ever ever after
If we just don't get it
Our own way
Ever ever after
It may only be
A wish away

Start a new fashion
Wear your heart
