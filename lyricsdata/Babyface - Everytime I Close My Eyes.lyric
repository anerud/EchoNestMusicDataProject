Girl, it's been a long, long time comin'
But I, I know that it's been worth the wait, yeah
It feels like springtime in winter it feels like Christmas in June
It feels like heaven has opened up it's gates for me and you

And every time I close my eyes I thank the Lord that I've got you, yeah
And you've got me too and every time I think of it
I pinch myself 'cause I don't believe it's true, yeah
That someone like you loves me too, yeah
