[60 Sec. Assassin]
Now children go when I send thee
Uh, now how should I send the law?
I'm gon' send the Killah Priest
Through the Sunz of Man
I'm gon' send in Bethlehem
It's the Sunz of Man, I'm gon' send in

[Killah Priest]
A world premier on the frontier for a year
Those with the ear, let 'em hear
I ride the camel, wearin' golden sandals
Gold shield, war force field
Silver spear, jasper armor flooded with onyx
Silk garment, a silk cape, a nickel plate breastplate
A golden helmet, a purple robe clothed with the velvet
Pullin' my diamond sword through ya pelvis, collar shinin like Elvis
Studied clubs, a golden club, roll out the white glove
I'm above, show you love for the general
Bag me the emeralds, never end the jewels
Attendin school of thoughts, red curtains, white turbans
Purple silk, blue quilt, sippin soy milk as the scales tilt
Holy tablets made from the Abbot's finest fabrics
Crystal glass, gold rims flooded with gems
The son of Shim sung me hymns
Enjoy the royal smell, golden bells
King Soloman's spells, holy vails
Instruments of excellence, new testaments
The annointed, flamboyant, rap for your enjoyment

[60 Sec. Assassin]
Now children go when I send thee
Uh, now how should I send the law?
I'm gon' send the Prodigal Sunn
