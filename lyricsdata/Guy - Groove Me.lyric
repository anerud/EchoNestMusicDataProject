Groove Me Baby! Do Me! (repeated throughout the entire song)

When I get you home tonight
It is gonna be alright
Girl, just do it now
And let's just take it nice and slow
Hey, girl, I know
Girl I'm in a romantic mood and sing too
Won't you groove me?
Groove Me Tonight (sing along with me)
Groove Me baby

Even if it's only for awhile
Enjoy this good loving with a smile
Do it wild tonight
