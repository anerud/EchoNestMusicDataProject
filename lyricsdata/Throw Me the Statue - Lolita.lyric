Lolita, I gotta see ya
I got a fire when she pulls me in
Those young girls love automatic
I want to make you lose your brain
For all I know

Come on over and she's pulling at my shirt
Like she's telling me to stay
Well, take a look over here
C'mon, I got the bullets in my head
And she asks me why I care

Shakin' off the dusty cape
Lacin' it up again
‘Cause she used to love it
So I bury my shame
She was nineteen and we all rearrange
