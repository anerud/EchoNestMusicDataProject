Dinosaur egg, oh dinosaur egg
When will you hatch?
'Cause I got a million people coming on Friday
And they expect to see a dinosaur, not an egg

Robot slave, oh robot slave
When will you spring to life?
'Cause I got a million people coming on Friday
And I don't expect to serve them drinks myself... myself
...
