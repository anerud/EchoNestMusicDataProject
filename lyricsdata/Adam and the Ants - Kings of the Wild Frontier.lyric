A new royal family, a wild nobility
We are the family
A new royal family, a wild nobility
We are the family
A new royal family, a wild nobility
We are the family

From centuries of taming
I feel beneath the white
There is a redskin suffering
From centuries of taming

No method in our madness (yeah)
Just pride about our maner (yeah)
