Failing and unsure
Why am I losing my nerve?
Wasting my time
Why do I only see this through the hurt?

I can't get it out of my head
I can't get it out that

I do this to myself, me and no one else
So help me, tell me how to break free
I'm to blame and that's what really hurts
That's what really hurts, you get what you deserve

Jaded and broken
