Ahhhhh!

I have the blood of men who've killed, inside my veins
Your threat to deconstruct my will cannot sustain
Unwritten laws of dignity ensure my fight
Think twice before you engage me, I will not hide

Can't stop my will

This violence resonates inside of me
I can't sedate all this rage, my thoughts obscene

The bitter end
The burning price
If this goes down, then I will take your life tonight
