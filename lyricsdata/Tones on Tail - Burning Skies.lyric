And the air was alive
With piercing sound and burning skies
The horror did me good,
The magic was on my side
And hot and cold ideas
Were running onto your eyes
Your sinking grey eyes
She shook his head like so much meat
The horror did me good
Time to exercise

Like ice about to melt
You empty yourself of everything
It's cold and grey again
...
