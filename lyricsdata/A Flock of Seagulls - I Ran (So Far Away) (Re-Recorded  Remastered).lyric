I walk along the avenue
I never thought i'd meet a girl like you
Meet a girl like you
With auburn hair and tawny eyes
The kind of eyes that hyptonize me through
Hypnotize me through

And i ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away

A cloud appears above your head
A beam of light comes shining down on you
Shining down on you
...
