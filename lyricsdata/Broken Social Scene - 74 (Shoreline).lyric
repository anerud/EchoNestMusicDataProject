It's a shoreline
And it's half speed
It's a cruel world and
And it's time

And you're walking away
But where to go to?
And you're walking alone
But how to get through?

If you wanna get it right
You can own what you choose
But you wanna live a lie
And love what you lose

It's a shoreline
And it's half speed
It's a cruel world and
It's time

While you're walking away
And I'm trying to get through
But you've gotta know their lies
From the lies they've told you
...
