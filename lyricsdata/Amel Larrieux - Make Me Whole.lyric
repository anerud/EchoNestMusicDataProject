Darlin i want you to listen,
i stayed up all night,
so i can get this thing right.
and i don't think,
there's anything missin'.
'cause a person like you,
made it easy to do.
I've waiten for so long,
to sing to you this song.
Cause your eyes are the windows to heaven,
your smile could heal a million souls.
your love completes my exsistence.
your the other half that makes me whole.
