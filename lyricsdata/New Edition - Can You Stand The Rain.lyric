On a perfect day
I know that i can count on you,
When that's not possible,
Tell me can you weather a storm
'Cause i need somebody who will stand by me,
Through the good times and the bad times
She would always, always be right there

[chorus]
Sunny days, everybody loves them,
(tell me baby)Can you stand the rain
Storms will come, this we know for sure
(this we know for sure)Can you stand the rain

Love unconditional,
...
