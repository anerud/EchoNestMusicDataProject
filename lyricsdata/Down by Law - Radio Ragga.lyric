oh rodney won't you play this song tonight? 
O radio can you save my soul tonight? 
Cause we saw you standing there 
please don't deny it 
waiting for the show to start 
I left feeling low -- did you feel the same way I did? 
Alone with a broken heart 
so radio radio get us through the night 
when pop heroes go down without a fight 
500 parkas were in the house tonight 
looking good and feeling right 
cigarettes were burning bright 
...
