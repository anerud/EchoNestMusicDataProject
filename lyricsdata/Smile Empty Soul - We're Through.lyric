In your face, i can see i've let you down
And the error of my ways, never listen to the sound
When you're crying out in pain

You push me deep in the river and drown the part of me
Forever that loved and ever gave a shit about you
So don't be surprised when i figure it out
I don't wanna see you foam at the mouth
When i tell you that i'm gonna leave you
We're through
