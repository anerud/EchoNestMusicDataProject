Whatcha say boo
If I asked, would you say
I do, I, I do

Whatcha say boo
If I asked, would you say
I do, I, I do

They said it wasn’t gonna last
They said we’re gonna split up fast
They told you I was a player
And I would play you

Nobody wanted us to be this way
It's just jealous in the lies they say
Could never touch us, 'cause the truth is lady
I’m still with you

Whatcha say boo
