(Verse)
We tried to guard but stayed through life
Others were trying but all is true
Shifting phase left us to realize
There’s nothing more that we can do
‘Cause it can’t go wrong, we can’t go right
Always a common thread between us

(Chorus)
Though our hearts and minds don’t waver
Waiting for love
That sound of danger
