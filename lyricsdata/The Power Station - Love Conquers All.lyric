In the beginning, darlin'
You made your first play
Living in a dream
Finding your way

Now it's for real
Learn from your feelings
Feel your resolve getting stronger with every day
Welcoming change

So wake up your heart and make a difference
Don't let your life and ambition just fade away
Make it real
