I could be anything I wanna be
I could be anything I wanna be
Like a bird flying up in the tree
Like a bee stinging for honey

I could be anything I wanna be
I could be anything I wanna be
Like a fish swimming in the sea
Like a copy of someone like me

I could be
I could be

I could be
I could be

I could be anything I wanna be
