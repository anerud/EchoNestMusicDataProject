Salome, uncross your heart
I know what goes on inside it's over before it starts
Well I'll stay all night, I'll wait right here
Full moon might work magic, girl but I won't disappear.

And I'm tired of makin' friends.
And I'm tired of makin' time.
And I'm sick to death of love.
And I'm sick to death of tryin'.
And it's easier for you
Yeah it's easier for you.

And it's easier for you
Yeah it's easier for you.
