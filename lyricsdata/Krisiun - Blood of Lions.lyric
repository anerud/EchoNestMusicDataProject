See me coming from beyond the mortal light
Flying high on the wings of the cursed time
Here it comes like a deadly thunderstorm
Decimating my enemies at dawn
Here I stand and draw a line - my existence remains undivine
Predator of the rising sun, for I fear no one
Ruler of the open steppe, vultures flying upon my path
Blood of lions - rushing thru my veins
