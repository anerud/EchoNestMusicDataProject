Everybody chokes
When they see someone cut down in their prime
It may not show when you look at me
But I know I'm in mine
I'm potent, baby, I'm potent
Dangerous to the naked eye
Rest your head on this bed of mother's pride
And find out why

Don't you wanna take me home?
Don't you wanna take me home?

Give me a sense of purpose
A real sense of purpose now
Aive me a sense of purpose
...
