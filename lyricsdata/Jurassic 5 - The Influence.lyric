Yo, I create off drum drops and ate away blacktops
Grab the mike so you don't react
The double X polo shirt with the hat to match
In fact, we verbally vibrate your track

Then crush your confidence like plastic condiments
Build you up to break you down like forgotten monuments
The question is this will they return with the hot shit
Or keep it on the low flow?

Yo, and for you confused bastards, tuna the blues master
Quick to grab the mike, crews fast and sound clashing
Critical mass, pinnacle blast have been deflected
Hypodermic vocals I flash get you infected

I don't sip on brew, so this bud's for you
Speak when spoken to whenever you come through
My vibes fill you, internal revenue
You rhyme prostitute for little or no loot

'Cause a lot of these kids think that commercial
Is rocking fly suits and jewelry
But we can rock shows with no rehearsal
With the rebels of rhythm and unity

Yeah, cause I'm nice, smooth, hard as a bone
Since I pick up the microphone I'm hotter than brimstone
The razor sharp crossbow accurate
We drop the multi verbal milligram supplement

Plus in bed, theological word advance
Been too legit to quit before the hammer pants
The parent to the pen converts words to song
Stay blacker than the new year Harlem renaissance

No comp, we paint a darker picture, in your sector
Perfect verbal architecture, sparking lectures
Lyrics infectious, fuck your Lexus
If you ain't giving God the praise then it's useless
