You know I don't mind if you think I should grow my hair
You know I don't mind if you pick on the clothes that I wear
But know I can keep my head when all around me are losing theirs, because

CHORUS: I am who I am
And you can't change me
I've done what I can
And I'll stand my ground
You're tying my hands
