[Incomprehensible]
Now

I can feel the animal inside
My resolve is weakening
Pounding on the doors of my mind
It's nearly overpowering

I cannot begin to describe
The hunger that I feel again
Run if you intend to survive
For the beast is coming to life

Taking more than a glimmer
Of this tainted moonlight
Death approaches on this night

For the animal's soul is mine
We will be completed right before your eyes
I have no control this time
