Tony Starks ya'll
Ghost, Bini and Case
C'mon, yeah
Sing that sh*t
Let'em have it

(Case)
Been around the world ladies come and go
Still I tell myself that you weren't one of those
That's what I get for being polite
I'm not upset or headed goodbye

Tried to love you tried to please you
It never made a difference I see
Shoulda known betta
I feel so dumb
Made you the one
It never made a difference I see
