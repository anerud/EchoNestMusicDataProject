I remember the day I first met you
You really caught my attention
Didn't know I was looking for a rescue
I wasn't thinking that hard

Now and then I was there in the moment
I was ready for nothing
Doesn't mean that I really didn't love you
While I'm breaking your heart

Don't ask why before we get too close
Just let me say goodbye, it's easier this way
Don't ask why before you ask some question
And I die inside, just let me walk away
