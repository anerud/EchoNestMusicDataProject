know you've been hurt by someone else i can tell by the way you carry yourself if you let me, here's what i'll do i'll take care of you i've loved and i've lost

i've asked about you and they've told me things but my mind didn't change i still the feel the same what's a life with no fun, please don't be so ashamed i've had mine, you've had yours we both know we know, they don't get you like i will my only wish is i die real cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal and you can't sleep thinking that he lies still so you cry still, tears all in the pillow case big girls all get a little taste pushing me away so i give her space dealing with a heart that i didn't break i'll be there for you, i will care for you i keep thinking you, just don't know try to run from that, say you're done with that on your face girl, it just don't show when you're ready, just say you're ready when all the baggage just ain't as heavy and the parties over, just don't forget me we'll change the pace and we'll just go slow you won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide you've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes
