Yeah, testing, testing, one two
Uhh, one
Press the panic button God

(all)
We be the crew, guess who, the Jayou
R-A-double-S, I-C, we're
in the place to be, it don't stop
We got the rhythm that makes your fingers
snap, crackle, pop pop, fizz fizz
We're known to give a show plus handle our biz-ness
Stress, we'll destroy
We're known to make noise as the original b-boys
in the flesh, greater to the depth
Creates the ill scenes when we manifest, yes

I feel the vibe
I feel the vibe too
Cause it's the butter from the crew
CAUSE WE ORIGINAL, WHO
Wanna tussle?
Flex for the muscle?
WHILE WE KICK THE STYLE THAT BUSTS YOUR BLOOD VESSLES
With the rhythm
The ninety-six stylism
PICK UP A PILL AND FEEL EM KILL EM WITH YOUR VOCALISM
