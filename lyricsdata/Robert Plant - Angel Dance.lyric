Good night, sleep tight
The big bright sun has gone away
Done gone away

Goodbye, don't cry
Tomorrow will bring us a brand new day
We can run and play

And they'll laugh up and down the hall
Don't you go shout when you hear them fall
Let them fly across the wall
Let them cry 'til the morning calls
Little two step angel dance
