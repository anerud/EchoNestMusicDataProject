Faces have trouble smiling
When it's less than a merry affair
When you communicate through
The writing on the wall
There's no love for you there
You wanted to draw a picture
But, your relationship could never hold a pose
You're left with a roomful of sketches
That only a hint at the love you wanted to know

Let it out. Let it go.
Hold back the tears no longer
Let them fall on the floor
Not on your will to be stronger

Who are you
In the face of disappointment
...
