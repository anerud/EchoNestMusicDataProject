Well you're in control and i know it
cause i'm miserable again
i don't understand how any of this
makes me a better man
you know i always run to you
for some help with my life
you know i always come to you
for a little wise advice
and all i get is pain
okay, so i'm exaggerating,
i'm just saying that's how it seems to me
...
