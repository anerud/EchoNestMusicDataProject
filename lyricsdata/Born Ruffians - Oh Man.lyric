Oh man. Oh man...
Go away man.
I want to sit right here & sip down the rest of my beer.

I got a funny feeling
I think she might be cheating and he knows.
Oh, he's gonna let it show.

She got the funny feeling, she put it on the ceiling.
& she's old
& I told her oh man, you're getting old man.
You're letting go old man
Why won't you understand?
You're on a roll man
Oh man, keep those knees up when you run.
Don't look behind or ahead
you're blind until you're dead.
