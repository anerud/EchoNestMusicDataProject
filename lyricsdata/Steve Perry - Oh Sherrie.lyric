You should've been gone
Knowing how I made you feel
And I should've been gone
After all your words of steel
Oh I must have been a dreamer
(must have been a dreamer I know)
And I must've been someone else
(someone else)
And we should've been over
(over now)

Oh Sherrie
Our love holds on
Holds on
Oh Sherrie
Our love holds on
Holds on
