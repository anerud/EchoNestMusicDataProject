Despite these imperfections
Despite all I say
Insight and recollection
I'm done with yesterday

I will lose my mind
And make real this time
To leave it all behind
I won't cry wolf
Show me a sign
Planets will align
I'm gonna blow my mind
I won't cry wolf

The one I trusted sold me
This is overblown
But I didn't want to believe
Everyone I trusted deceived me
...
