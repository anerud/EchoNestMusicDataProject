The hand that rocks the cradle, is the hand that rocks the world
And I'm the brother that be rockin all y'all hip hop boys and girls
My head is full of curls, dreads, twists and naps
Under that's my thinkin cap, full of efficient raps
Yo, I hit you off with 'em, once they're mastered with perfection
Knock your head up with ideas, that's "Immaculate Conception"
I roll with a crew that has accurate perception
I 'ent my delegates like the night before election
I don't fiend for attention but I fiend for affection
But if there's no protection, Akro ain't connectin
And that could mean Jim Hats or venue security
But if Akro's on the bill, you gotta make it with purity
And when I say pure, it means you can be sure
Real hip hop is comin out the box real RAW!
I feel for the state of affairs and how it runs
So I blast for my music and for my mind for the fun ...

(*"Fun" - repeated several times*)

The black action figure with the rap kung fu grip
When Ak's in action nigga, prepare for the 1-2 dip
