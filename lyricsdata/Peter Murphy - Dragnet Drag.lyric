Look at them now
Look at them do
Look they found the dove
Their vastness too
Whirlpools whirl
And dragnets drag

Love me do oh love me do
Love me find the dove
This vastness sings a pretty song
This vastness must be love
Give me three the gift of one
Whose science can't describe
Whose eyes are peeled like atom bombs
Their spirit is the prize

The sufi three winged flight they soar
All sacrals join all hearts
...
