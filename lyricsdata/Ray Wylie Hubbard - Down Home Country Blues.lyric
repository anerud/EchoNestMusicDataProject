Sugar's got some sweetness to it
As do my baby's lips
And when she hears some ol' howlin' wolf
She got to move her hips

She ain't much for the bluegrass fiddle
She likes that bottleneck slide
A little kick with a lot of bottom
Let the resonator take the ride

So listen up, oh, lookie here
I'm talkin' 'bout them country blues

Now you can take some Black Diamond strings
