Children, I wanna warn ya
'Cos I've been to California
Where Mickey Mouse is such a demon
Where Mickey Mouse is as big as a house

Life is wasted on illusions
Tom and Jerry's no solution
Evil gangs will cut the demons
Pinocchio is a real boy, look around

And I cry all night
Do you wanna hold me, hold me tight?
Do you wanna hold me, oh yeah?
Do you wanna hold me, hold me there?

Children, you got to hand me
