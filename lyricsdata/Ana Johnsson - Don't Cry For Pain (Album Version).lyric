Hey man, here's my plan
I'm gonna break it
Hey you, don't be sad
Here's your chance so take it

If you slap my face
If you don't call
Honestly, I don't care at all

Maybe I'm a bit complicated
All I know is

I don't cry for pain
Don't cry from fear
You know that

I don't cry in the rain
No not a tear
You know that

Before you leave, when you go
I think you ought to know
I don't cry for pain
I only cry for love
