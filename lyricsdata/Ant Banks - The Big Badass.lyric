For 94 shit, bitch... That Ant Banks shit... 
 No, you can't fade it doe... Lets do this shit, Banks! 
 Let these hoes know... 
 
 A nigga smooth hit a lick 
 And shit i came up quick 
 With some bumpin' ass beats 
 And a gang of dick for the hoes 
 Ant Banks just lay that shit 
 And for the way I hit it 
 You gotta pay me to quit, hoe 
 Cause I'm all about the cashflow 
 Sittin' back on somethin' phat 
 I know your ass know 
 Nigga comin' kinda tight for 94 
 Eyes on the prize, leavin' marks behind me, yo 
 I'm still kickin' it, rollin' in my Benzo 
 Fly day at mall and a boatload of endo 
 Just tossin' in the town with the Badass! 
 Hey, baby! What's up? 
 Not you, bitch, with your fat ass!" 
 Bumpin' bitches with my loced out tactics 
 Straight pimpgame is all that I practice 
 You can find me on the strip 
 Just actin' a fool 
 I got love in the town cause I'm so damn cool 
 I make the hoes wanna kick it 
 And drop'em drawls 
 And throw'em jaws all on my balls 
 I run some drama on your mama 
 Make her think I'm a square 
 Knowin' goddamn well
