She said I cannot tell you why, she said I'm in a rush
There are softer dreams for you to think about now love
Things that you have seen this night that run by that the river's flow
I can use you if you're in the flame, I'm a growin' old

And no this is not the summer dream she said
It's just the drying of the lawns I want to leave out there

Well I've said I've sailed the frozen corners of the dark Atlantic Sea
And I drifted on the waves and the mirage beneath
And never have I felt such numb and pointless searchin' true
...
