You're gonna meet some strangers
Welcome to the zoo
Bitter disappointments
Except for one or two
Some of them are angry
Some of them are mean
Most of them are twisted
Few of them are clean

Now when you go dancing with young men down at the disco
Just keep it simple
You don't have to kiss though

Don't waste time with the idiots that think that they're heroes
They will betray you
Stick with us weirdos
