We came to party, so where's the party-y? Come on, let's party (let's go)We wanna party, you wanna party-y
Let's start the party
Party with the Hampster Dance
Been around the world and back again
Now I'm gonna party with all of my friends
We got Fuzzy, Hado and Dixie too
Now we're all here to party with you
We came to party, so where's the party-y? Come on, let's party (let's go)We wanna party, you wanna party-y
