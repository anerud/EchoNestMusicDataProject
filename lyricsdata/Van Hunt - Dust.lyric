It's just another day another episode
Of hiding under the world
It's just another ray of merciful hope
I don't expect many more

I'm already insane
I'm already in pain

And if this time you don't rescue me
I won't blame you at all
'Cause you see, I know that I've gone in too deep
For you to risk a fall

I'm already insane
Yes, I am
I'm already in pain
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes
I'm already insane
...
