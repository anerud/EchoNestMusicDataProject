My mind is flooded
Skies rain the news
I can name 300 medicines
I just can't choose
My skull for a filter
My house for a lock
I can name 300 medicines
Won't stop all this talk
Free shit from bodegas, a nighttime so dim
The power comes back, we're lit to the brim
Learn how to gamble don't learn how to swim
Now i told you, now you know
Our sea all undertow
