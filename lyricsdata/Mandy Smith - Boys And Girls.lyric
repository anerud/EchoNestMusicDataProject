I like to watch the sun go down
At the end of that beautiful day
Neon lights of the city glow
And I'm dressed up ready to play
On the street there's a rhythm that's moving my feet
And the night is young
And the fun has only just begun
Chorus:

All you beautiful people
All you beautiful boys and girls
...
