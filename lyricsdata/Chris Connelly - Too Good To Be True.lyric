The moment explodes every evening
A fountain of flames melt the way
Here she comes now collectin predictions
A waking eclipse with nothing to say
A paper-thin prayer will herald the morning
Sent up in a scare you held in you sleep
It burns in the sun before we could see it
A waking emission that no one could keep
Past came to life flew away and died
