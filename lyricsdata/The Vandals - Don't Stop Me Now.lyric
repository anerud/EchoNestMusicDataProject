Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel ali ha ha hive and the world's turning inside out
I'm floating around in ecstasy, don't stop me now
Don't stop me now I'm having a good time, having a good time

I'm a shooting star dancing through the sky
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go there's no stopping me

I'm burning through the night, two hundred degrees
I said, "They call me Mr. Fahrenheit"
I'm traveling at the speed of light
I'm gonna make a supersonic man of you

Don't stop me now I'm having such a good time
