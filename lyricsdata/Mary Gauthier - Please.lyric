JOHN
I'm not here as a friend
I have a job to do
it's strange to find my work
should lead me here to you
Chris knows all about you
I have shown him all this
but I think that it's time
you know all about Chris

KIM
please, don't you see that's all I live for?
I have him and nothing more
at night, everything that's not him
disappears behind my door

JOHN
please, he went crazy when he lost you
spoke to no one for a year
then he finally said "I'm home now,
my life has to go on here"

please, let me finish talking, please
this was three whole years ago

KIM
