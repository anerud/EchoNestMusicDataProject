Across the space that separates
Your social world from mine
We built a threadbare bridge of words
It didn't stand the test of time.
Now we're here,
I don't know why.
I'd rather talk some more
Than look into your eyes.
Just waiting for the bell to ring
So we can live our separate lives.

Sorry to embarrass you,
...
