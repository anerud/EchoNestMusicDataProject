[Tajai]
Back back, way back, I used to fret that my honey
Would play me for one with more pap(er)s, still it was funny
'Cause she paid no mind as jerks lurked constantly
And my insecurity turned into maturity (I matured)
As the years pass I find it hard to be monogamous
So do other brothers,? and (?)? still synonymous
Catch crazy glance when I'm with female company
Some think I'm a softie and they step to her in front of me
So in public places I am often found in my trunk
Reaching for bats, and *smack* goes his spunk
Because I have the right to riff, and in spite
Of a few protests, progress and I might smite you
Once you come, your fronts, they got no future
Blunts blur my sight, get left and right suture
I know this, and also notice advances:
I peeped them pap(er)s in which he slipped to my dip
With numerals, and you're soon to roast thinking I'm jelly
'Cause numbers left in the gutter lead to lonely tellies (telephones)
(God damn, why won't she call?)
'Cause we see who's pee-wee and we see who's me
The difference is Vaseline: You're slipping while I'm skin-dipping
Grips, and grips of chumps my way:
Slumped from back-bumps on rumps, 'cause I flay
So why play, 'cause Tajai has to flip
I found mine, so find your own companionship

[Chorus]
Every time I see you in the world
You always step my girl
But ask yourself homeboy - Why is that?
