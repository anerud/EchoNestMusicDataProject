I got another gang story to tell
Peep about how a black nigga was born in hell
And right then and there it's no hope
'Cause a nigga can't escape the gangs and the dope
Damn! And when its black on black that makes it shitty
Can't survive in the Compton city, and fool thats bet
'Cause when you grow up in the hood you got to claim a set

Ge ah its not that you want to but you have to
Don't be a mark, 'cause niggas might laugh you
Straight off the motherfuckin' block
Can't deal with bust as so they asses get clocked
Ge ah, who gives a fuck about another
Only got love for my fuckin' gang brothers
Ge ah but I'm young so nobody would wonder
That the hood would take me under

Always strapped and eager to peel a cap
The hood done took me under
Always strapped and eager to peel a cap
The hood done took me under

Now I'm a few ages older
Got hair on my nuts and I'm a little bit bolder
...
