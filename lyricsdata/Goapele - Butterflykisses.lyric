You cam eto me in a dream
all the qualities I asked for
in a man
just understand me
love me as you know me
I'll let yo know me well
I don't anticipate putting up a gate
or shelter around my heart.
I intend to find the good in side
promise the real you
so pure
so I can give you


Butterflykisses
and pleasure you can feel
...
