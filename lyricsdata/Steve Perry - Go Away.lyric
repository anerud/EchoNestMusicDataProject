We meet again
Right in the middle
Of a love I knew before
Another girl, she looks a lot like you
I'm cruisin' many
So are you
That's the way we both should do
I don't know why
We had this rendezvous

Go away
Go away
I sing goodbye to you
When the song's gone
You'll be on
On to someone new

So here we are
Right in the middle
