One by one goes the bullets in the clip
Put it in yo gat, one in the chamber, now you're ready to start shit
Heat comin' from the barrel with a cloud of smoke
Dead bodies on the ground when these fools get loc'ed

It's crazy in the street, pack some heat for a sucker
Mobbin' through the town tryin' to murder muthafuckas
211's every day, liquor store and bank jobs
D boys gettin' robbed, niggas get jacked for they mobbs

What's a nigga to do, can't survive without a gun
Snitches in the street, a nigga livin' on the run
It's fun but the pen is like smokin' sess
Locked up on a 187'll make any nigga stress

You can wear a vest, it won't stop two to the head
Shot you in your face and now your ass is better off dead
Talkin' shit'll get you smoked quick
No need to save a hoe because they can't live without dick

So I focus on the mail, Celly Cel
Ain't no playa-hatin nigga, I got too much heat to sell
Fairy tales I never kick, it's gangsterism in my veins
I kicked it with the O G's pickin up on game

Get your money on, fuck a bitch and get ghost
And keep one in the chamber for them fools that play you close
Them sick wid' it niggas keep makin' the beat 4 yo azz
Ciggedy-Cel, the figgedy-funky nigga got some heat 4 yo azz

Some heat 4 yo azz, some heat 4 yo azz
Them sick wid' it nigga got the beat 4 yo azz
Some heat 4 yo azz, some heat 4 yo azz
That nigga Celly Cel got some heat 4 yo azz

Some heat 4 yo azz, some heat 4 yo azz
Them sick wid' it nigga got the beat 4 yo azz
Some heat 4 yo azz, some heat 4 yo azz
That nigga Celly Cel got some heat 4 yo azz
