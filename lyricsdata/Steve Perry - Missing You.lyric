Oh I'm (missing you)
the hurt on your heart
Through your eyes it shows
The past can't relive
What we both know
Still I remember
Things I never meant
Memories surround me
Won't let me forget
I was so wrong
The secret's not worth keeping
I had no faith
That you would still believe
No, now
My heart's in your keeping
...
