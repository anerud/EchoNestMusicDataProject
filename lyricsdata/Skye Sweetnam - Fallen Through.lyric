I do what he says
but i end up falling off the edge
I dont know what to do
Never seems to end up being true
Seeps in underneath the door
Sinks in and stains the floor
I dont know what to feel
Takes so long for these wounds to heal
Tell me its not really real

Fallen through
Why did i fall for you?
Fallin' for all the lies alabis that you said
...
