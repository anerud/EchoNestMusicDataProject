So difficult to embrace or qualify
Find resolve as the earth keeps turning
Don't tell it seems too real
We're satisfied with the lies that we think and feel

Too fine a point to arrange
When dealing with obsession
To put a face on the pain
I will try to embrace it
Can't pull away from the mains
As everyone keeps drowning
This time it's worse than the signs
We framed then failed to identify
