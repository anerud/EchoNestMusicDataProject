You didn't see my valentine
I sent it via pantomime
While you were watchin' someone else
I stared at you and cut myself

It's all I'll do 'cause I'm not free
A fugitive too dull too flee
I'm amorous but out of reach
A still life drawing of a peach

I'm a tulip in a cup
I stand no chance of growing up
I've made my peace I'm dead, I'm done
...
