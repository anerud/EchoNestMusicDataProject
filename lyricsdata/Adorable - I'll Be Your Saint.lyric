I'll be your saint
I'll wear a halo
And I'll perform miracles
If you want me to stoop that low
I'll be a saint
I'll be a saint

I'll be your saint
I'll be your saint
I'll be your word, I'll be your life, I'll be your heart, I'll be your lights
I will be
I'll be word, I'll be love, I'll be heart, I'll be your god
...
