I cannot help it
I couldn't stop it if I tried
The same old heart beat
Fills the emptiness
I have inside
And I've heard that you can't fight love
So I won't complain
Cause why would I stop the fire
That keeps me going on

'Cause when there's you
I feel whole
And there's no better feeling in the world
But without you
I'm alone
And I'd rather be in love
With you

Turn out the lights now
...
