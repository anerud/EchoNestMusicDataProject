Alright I might
Have had a little glare when I stared at your ho
But I didn't know she was like that, she stared right back
My niggas was warnin' me that she was comin' on to me

I react like a mack do I act cool
Just to test her 'cause I ain't no jester
I suggest her and her friend be outtie
Because I don't want to make my pals get rowdy

And doubt me our friendship
But when lips touch
I go crazy in the clutch
Sorta like a schitzo I forgets my bros and pals over gals

I didn't mean to but when you fiend you do
Strange things for the [Incomprehensible] denim no matter who's in em
Grab a flooze then I'm in traffic
Don't laugh it might be your girl that I'm talkin' about
I didn't mean to

It ain't my fault that your girl got caught
It ain't my fault that your girl got caught
It ain't my fault that your girl got caught
It ain't my fault that your girl got caught

It ain't my fault that your girl got caught
It ain't my fault that your girl got caught
It ain't my fault that your girl got caught
It ain't my fault that your girl got caught
