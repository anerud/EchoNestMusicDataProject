Do do do, do do, do do do do do do do do
What's the point of tryin' to meet you in the middle?
You got your point of view, there's nothing I can do
Can't change your mind, can't leave it all behind
You're livin' in the past
We talk and talk, this goes on for hours
About how I should be, why is it all on me?
Don't wanna fight, don't wanna waste my time
baby this can't last, I'm movin' on, movin' on

(chorus)

Can I go now?
You said what you had to say
Happy you got your way, there's nothing to discuss
(Can I go now?)
Well you're givin' your point of view,
Said what you wanted to, what's the point in us?
(Can I go now)
Oh, say what you had to say,
Happy you got your way, what's there to discuss?
(Can I go now?)
