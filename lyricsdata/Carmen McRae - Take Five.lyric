Won't you stop and take a little time out with me, just take five;
Stop your busy day and take the time out to see I'm alive.

Though I`m going out of my way,
Just so I can pass by each day,
Not a single word do we say,
It`s a pantomime and not a play

Still I know our eyes often meet,
I feel tingles down to my feet,
...
