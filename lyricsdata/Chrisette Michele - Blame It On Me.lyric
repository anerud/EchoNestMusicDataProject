Sometimes you can work it out, sometimes you can't
Sometimes you're forced to watch everything fall apart
It's outta your hands

Sometimes leaving is easy, sometimes it ain't
Sometimes it hurts to know the loving you had
Is slowly fading away

You can say whatever you like as long as we just say goodbye
Blame it on me, say it's my fault
Say that I left you outside in the cold with a broken heart
I really don't care, I ain't crying no more
Say I'm a liar, a cheater, say anything that you want as long as it's over
