We found each other blown between the trees
Waning moons wanting to be swallowed by the sea
Like we finally saw the colors of the world

Like we finally saw the colors of the world

We felt the sun leave us for the west
Little lips always folding farther from the breast
Like we finally saw the colors of the world
