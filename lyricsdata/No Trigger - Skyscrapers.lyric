I never repeat gossip so listen carefully
it means something to me the studs and joist braces
drywall dust in our faces
three years will make you think
dealing with living mistakes
harness the strength ripping down the walls
between fun and fear
put the plan in gear and go
we'll make it on our own
fake it as we go
...
