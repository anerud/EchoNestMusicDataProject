Maybe we're just getting older
But the songs, they ain't the same
I'm tired of living from day to day
You're still playing them fucking games
I just don't look at things the same
But my mind's growing more every day
In my mind I've started to see things clearer
Now I know who I am when I look in that fuckin mirror
