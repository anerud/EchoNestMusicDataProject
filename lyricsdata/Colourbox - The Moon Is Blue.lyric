Feel these hands that
Shake this world
Then try to understand

When the light shines down
And the time goes slowly
When my mind's in the dusk
Scorched and dying
There's a pain in my hand
Inscribed to the sad and lonely
Now I feel so cold and alone
Thinking how long

Now if you had told me
She'll be coming back
And if you had told me
The clock was gonna fall
And if you had shown me
Some affection
