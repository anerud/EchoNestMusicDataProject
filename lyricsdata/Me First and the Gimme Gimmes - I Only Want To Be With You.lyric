I don't know what it is that makes me love you so
I only know I never want to let you go
'Cause you've started something
Oh can't you see?
That ever since we met yu've had a hold on me
It happens to be true
I only want to be with you

It doesn't matter where you go or what you do
I want to spend each moment of the day with you
