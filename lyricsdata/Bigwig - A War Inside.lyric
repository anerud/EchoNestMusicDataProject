For so long we slave under the gun
And this war inside is never won
I have always sworn that I won't conform
I refuse to suffer anymore

The calm before the storm
You were never warned
You always think it's up to them again to bail you out
Responsibility is now priority
Well don't forget the fact we eat, sleep, and breathe here...
But never fear

For so long we slave under the gun
And this war inside is never won
I have always sworn that I won't conform
...
