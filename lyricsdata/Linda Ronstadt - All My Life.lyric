Am I really here in your arms?
It's just like I dreamed it would be
I feel like we're frozen in time
and you're the only one I can see

*Chorus*
Hey, I've lived all my life for you
Now you're here
Hey, I'll spend all my life with you
All my life

And I never really knew how to love
I just hope somehow I'd see
Oh I. asked for a little help from above
Send that angel down to me
