My drinking days are over
No more nights at the Carousel
My buddies say they're gonna miss me but
Who could ever tell
I never knew what time it was
Til closing time came round
My drinking days are over
But I'm still troublebound

I used to hang at the Horseshoe
You'd see me spinning at the Broken Spoke
I'd take my gal to The Gaslight
