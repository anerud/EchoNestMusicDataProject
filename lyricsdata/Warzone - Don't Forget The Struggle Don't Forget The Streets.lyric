It's been a few years now - we're going strong
We've been through a lot of good and bad
Some gave up - they had no heart
For you and me - this world won't tear us apart
From the East Coast to the West Coast
Inside myself I can hear the screams
The style - all over
It may be different - but in our hearts - it's all the same
Don't forget the struggle
Don't forget the streets
Don't forget your roots
