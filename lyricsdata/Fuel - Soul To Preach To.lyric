Fed myself a long hard day
Helps to ease the tracks on my mind
Thought I'd be much more some way
Did I miss the killin' time?

Oh I look at all the times
I should have walked away
Oh I look at all the times
I should have cared

Now I'm lookin' out for a soul to preach to
What I'm searchin' for is just a world away
