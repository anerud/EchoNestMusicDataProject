Underspent and too young, too
I stumbled onto a, a picture of you
You wild bitter tale, all cherry oak and tears
As the branches looked in

The summer is done and we are too, dear
Pull back the drape
And let the silent light in
Soon, I'll be on that highway

And damn this stretch of 99
That takes so many lives
One of them was mine

Hand me that lil wallet picture
1985, one more time
