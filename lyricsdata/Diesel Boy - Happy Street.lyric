I think I'll go for a walk outside
The sun is out it's a beautiful day
I love to feel the wind in my hair
And the sun on my face
Cheap thrills come easy these days
At least that's what I'm told
Well it sure beats watching TV 
And just sitting around growing old
Can't help but smile
When I'm on happy street
Big rows of houses and concrete

I think I'll go outside for a walk
...
