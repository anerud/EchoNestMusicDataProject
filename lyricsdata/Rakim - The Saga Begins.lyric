Ahh
Ghetto music
Yo
Here we go

And my name is Rakim
And my name is Rakim
And my name is Rakim
And my name is Rakim
And my name is Rakim, Rakim

Yo, the saga begins, my eyes is the photography lens
Properly push pens and show quality gems
The horrors be grim but yo maybe tomorrow we win
If we follow the trends and keep count of the dollars we spend

I want a mahogany Benz, I want lottery ends
I want property, friends, plus my hobby is skins
If I decide we in sin, then my prophecy ends
But the God'll begin, watchin' my odyssey spin

In the place where war be, based on a true story
Territory was made for me to pursue glory
Blast alone masses in zones have to be sewn
Every capacity blown, I'm internationally known, yo

So all hail the honorable, microphone phenomenal
Persona is unbombable, trust me son
I continue like a saga do, bringin' you the drama to
Allow you that the chronicle has just begun

The saga begins
The soul controller, Rakim
Set it off, yo, the saga begins
Still say a rhyme after the next one

The saga begins
...
