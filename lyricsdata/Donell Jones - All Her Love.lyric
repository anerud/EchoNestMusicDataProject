(Verse 1)
She's got a man, another situation
I understand that's how it's got to be
Ain't trying to cause her no complications
I'd walk away, but I'm in too deep
I can't make no plans, got me so frustrated
'Cause in my heart I want you desperately
Done ran away from all the girls I've been dating
When I'm with them, it's only you I see
And she promised me that it would take some time
But she would leave him alone
And the thought of her loving only me
That's the thing that keeps me strong

(Chorus)
She give me all her love
But only half the time
Still it's more than enough
To keep my hope alive
