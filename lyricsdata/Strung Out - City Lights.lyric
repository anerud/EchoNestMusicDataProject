We're alive in the modern world so far out of reach
Desperate souls in this electric sea
Well city lights won't guide my way and I'm running out of time
There's wreckage all around me in every passing car and freeway sign
It's a tale about the end of the world,
Encrypted in the heart of us all
We are the dark we are the light
We are the voice you hear at night
We are the architects of void
