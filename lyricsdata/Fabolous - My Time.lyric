Go hard today, can't worry the past
'Cause that was yesterday
I'ma put it on the line 'cause it's my time
I gotta stay on my grind 'cause it's my time, my time, my time

If you're with me let me hear you say
My, my, my, my
If you're with me let me hear you say
My, my, my, my, it's my time

Guess what time it is, my, my, my time
You can check your iPhone, better say it's our time
I don't even need a watch, I don't even see a clock
Soon as a I walk in it feel like me o'clock

Give me a clock, every time I check
Singers don't measure up and try and blame the Pyrex
I'ma do it bigger than a 5-ex
Can't ride with an L so I don't drive Lex

Games so bickery, so full of trickery
Nursery, rhyming, hickory, dickory
Blowing that side, the hood call it pickory
Biggie, Puffy, Busta victory

Go hard today, can't worry the past
'Cause that was yesterday
I'ma put it on the line 'cause it's my time
