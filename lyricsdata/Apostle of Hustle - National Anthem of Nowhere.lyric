We are words that float through her veins
Her sexual use of pain
And she sends her sailors in
Well they don't come back
And they don't get in

We are sailors drunk as wine
They forget the house in time
They begin upon the rocks
Too many arms
On an octopus

National Anthem of Nowhere
Winds come trolling
The sea don't care
...
