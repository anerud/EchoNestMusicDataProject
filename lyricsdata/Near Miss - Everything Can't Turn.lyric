It's time to realize
People have gone their separate ways
Years have passed now and things just aren't the same
I can think of a time when I was free
Never listened to the ones
Who said "Hold on and face reality"
It's bringing me down to see what's all around
And I can't even tell but this life don't seem or feel so well
And it's true that everything can't turn for you
...
