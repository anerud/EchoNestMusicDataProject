Sickness spilling through your eyes
Craving everything that you thought was alive
Stab me in my heart again
Drag me through your wasted life
Are you forever dead?

Do like I told you stay away from me
Never misunderstand me keep away from me

Twisting everything around that you say, yeah
Smack me in my mouth 200 times every other day
Oh
Rag me I don't hear you anymore
Find out what it means to me
I don't know who you are.
