Hey, hey, hey, sweet thing
I give in
Sweet thing
I give in (submission)
(Don't you want to right it, fight it)
Oh, no, if you don't think it's right
Can't change your mind if I talk all night
(Don't you want to right it, fight it)
Oh, no, 'cos nothing now can keep this a good thing.

Hey, hey, hey, sweet thing
I give in
Sweet thing
I give in (submission)
(Don't you want to right it, fight it)
Just go.
