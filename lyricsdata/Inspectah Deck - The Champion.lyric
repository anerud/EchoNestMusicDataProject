He's been taking it easily
And then suddenly the moment changed
Suddenly, the moment changed, watch it and

He has put together a flurry and put the champion away
But no one has ever been able to do that
And he's tryin' ta survive to the final bell, what a fight

You never will conquer the champion, ooh, ooh
You never will conquer the champion

I stream machine gun funk, trunk slayer
Major Payne game hunter, summer time shine
Mind controller, hold the crowd still hill top dweller

Sell the garden out, House Gang chain
Cuban Link blink, lose shoes, you can never wear
Stare hard, God rise above, love hate, make your choice
Voice like Luther, future Hall of Famer
