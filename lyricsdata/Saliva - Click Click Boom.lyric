C'mon, c'mon!
C'mon, c'mon!

On those Saturdays when kids go out and play,
Yo, I was up in my room, I let the stereo blaze.
Wasn't faded, not jaded, just a kid
With a pad and a pen and a big imagination.
All this, I seek, I find,
I push the envelope to the line.
Make it, break it, take it
Until I'm overrated!

Click, click, boom!
I'm coming down on the stereo, hear me on the radio,
Click, click, boom!
I'm coming down with the new style and you know it's buck wild,
Click, click, boom!
I'm on the radio station, touring 'round the nation,
Leaving the scene in devastation.

I can see it in my mind,
I can see it in their eyes,
It's close enough to touch it now,
But far away enough to die!
