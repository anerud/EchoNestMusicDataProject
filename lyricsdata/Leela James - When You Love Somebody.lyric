What is a woman
To do with a man
Who treats her unkindly
When she's down, all she can

I cried so many nights
How we fuss and fight
The make ups and the break ups
I loved you and only you
The things you do

When you love somebody
When you love somebody
(things you do, ooh)

I gave you my lovin'
With no questions asked
Tears on my pillow
From all your disrespect

I didn't care about your past
