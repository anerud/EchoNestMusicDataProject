Waking up to find another day
The Moon got lost again last night
But now the Sun has finally had its say
I guess I feel alright

But it hurts when I think
When I let it sink in
It's all over me
I'm lying here in the dark
I'm watching you sleep, it hurts a lot

And all I know is
You've got to give me everything
Nothing less 'cause
You know I give you all of me
I give you everything that I am
I'm handin' over everything that I've got
'Cause I wanna have a really true love
Don't ever wanna have to go and give you up
Stay up 'til four in the morning and the tears are pouring
And I want to make it worth the fight
What have we been doing for all this time?
