My eyes has never seen someone so beautiful
So much charm, so much class
You're the first thought of each day

So appealing you are, you move through me
Such a natural feeling
And oh, please don't take it away

I can get caught up when I see you
You're so beautiful
I can get caught up when I see you
You're so beautiful

I have received a love that's so divine
