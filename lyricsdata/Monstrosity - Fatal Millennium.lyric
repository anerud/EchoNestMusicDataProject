Destroyers of the world before
Underneath a deeper realm
Parallels in their shallow common ground
Brings the destruction of their will

The racing minds of the sickened
Holding fast to a world so vast
Empty beings so convinced
In the end is when their time begins
Rivaled like none before
Unchallenged in the face of hate
Adorned with the tides of atrophy

Formed from the injected fallacy
Faced with concepts of reality
Beginning with the experiment
Betrayal will come at the first sight of blood

In the trenches of corruption
