Aaahh, aaahh, aaahh
It feels good yeah / It feels good
Oh it feels good / It feels good / sure feels good to me

If the rhythm feels good to you baby
Let me hear you sing
If the rhythm feels good to you baby
Let us take you away

Moments that we share / special times alone
Just don't ever change / cause I'm so into you
