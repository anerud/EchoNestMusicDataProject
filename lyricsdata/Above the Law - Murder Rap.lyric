(Cause a brother like me said, well...)

Yo, Cold 187
They tryin to give you a murder rap
And you ain't even like that
Yo, serve these niggas, cause they deserve to get dissed
(Yeah)
(Check this out)

When I sit down and write and recite for the mic I hold
Make sure my beats are loud, and bold, and Cold
187, that is my name, makin it simple and plain
Here to rearrange and change
The things that I didn't do in the past
Don't be surprised when you got a shotgun up your ass
Perpetrators, that one was just for you
I'm gonna leave ya in your seat remaining without a clue
Glued to my style like a fiend on coke
But if you say the wrong thing, I wash your mouth out with soap
Dope is not the answer
No, I'm not a Cancer
No, I'm not a hero or zero
But a Leo in stereo
And this is not a demo
K-oss and Go Mack be cuttin the flex tempo
Fast

(Now I got a murder rap)
(Cause a brother like me said, well...)

Yo, fingerprints ain't nothin without the murder weapon
Keep steppin
Homicide tried to sweat, but we let em have it
You can see they fear through they tears
Treat em like Robanes and give em some relief
