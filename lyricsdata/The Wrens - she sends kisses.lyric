ten tons against me and you've gone
I put your favorite records on
and sit around

and you're around again
struck dumb while drugs run at how high reeds

cut crap, who's filling shoes like these anymore?
past clumsy crushes beneath Thrill Pier
hopes pinned to poses honed in men's room mirrors
a sophomore at Brown
