You remember, I will always
See you for the liar you are
And if I were gone tomorrow
Then finally you would see all my scars

This won't get the best of me
Won't try to even listen to me
You keep clinging on to me
But I feel my sanity drain and

I feel the break I
Can feel the break I
Can feel the break I
Can feel the break I

You remember, I will always
See you for the liar you are
And if I were gone tomorrow
...
