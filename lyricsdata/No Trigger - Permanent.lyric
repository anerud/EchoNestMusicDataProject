I can't settle down
With the cracking sound
Of broken bonds still ringing in my head
Laughter stops stomach knots
No one wins the mountain top
The steel gets tired of the rust and folds
Never in control
History does not disappear or get old
Let me get this straight it's all around and written off
As a life expense
