Holding back the years,
Thinking of the fear I've had so long.
When somebody hears,
Listen to the fear that's gone.
Strangled by the wishes of pater,
Hoping for the arms of mater,
Get to neither sooner or later,

Holding back the years,
Chance for me to escape from all I know.
Holding back the tears,
Cause nothing here has grown.
