I'm not the one who's so far away
When I feel the snakebite enter my veins
Never did I wanna be here again
And I don't remember why I came

Candles raise my desire
Why I'm so far away
No more meaning to my life
No more reason to stay

Freezing feeling
Breathe in, breathe in
I'm coming back again

I'm not the one who's so far away
...
