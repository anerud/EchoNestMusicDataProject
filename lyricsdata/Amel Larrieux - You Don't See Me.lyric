There you are
Here I am
You're so close but so far
All we are is friends
But that's not enough
When it's strong, it can't wait
Like my love
Been so long that I've felt this way

()
But you don't see
You don't see me
You don't see I'm in deep as I can be
You don't see me, you don't see
You don't see me

()
What's the deal?
Are you blind?
I'm on fire
Can't you feel?
How I lose my mind
When you smile
I need you just stop
Look in my eyes
