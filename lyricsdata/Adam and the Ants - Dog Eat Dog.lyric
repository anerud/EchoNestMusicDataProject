You may not like
The things we do
Only idiots
Ignore the truth

It's easy to
Lay down and hide
Where's the warrior
Without his pride?

We're gonna move real good (yeah, right)
We're gonna dress so fine (OK)
It's dog eat dog eat dog eat dog eat dog
Eat dog eat dog eat dog eat dog
Leapfrog the dog
Brush me daddy-o

(Ah)
(Ah, ah)
