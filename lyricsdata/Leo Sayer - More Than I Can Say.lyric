Oh-woah-yay-yay
I love you more than I can say
I'll love you twice as much tomorrow, woah
Love you more than I can say

Oh-woah-yay-yay
I'll miss you every single day
Why must my life be filled with sorrow, oh
Love you more than I can say

Oh, don't you know I need you so
Oh, tell me please, I got to know
Do you mean to make me cry?
Am I just another guy?
