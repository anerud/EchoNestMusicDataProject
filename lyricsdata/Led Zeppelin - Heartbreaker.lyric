Hey, fellas, have ya heard the news
Ya know that Annie's back in town
It won't take long, just watch and see

But from her eyes a different smile like of the one who knows

Well it's been ten years or maybe more
since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by, here I am alone and blue
