laudate omnes gentes laudate
magnificat in secula
et anima mea laudate
magnificat in secula

happy nation living in a happy nation
where the people understand
and dream of the the perfect man
a situation leading to sweet salvation
for the people for the good
for mankind brotherhood

we're traveling in time

ideas by man and only that will last
...
