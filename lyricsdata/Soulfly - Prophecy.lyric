I see the Red Sea part in front of me
I see the desert clouds bleed above me
I'm with the prophets on the final destiny
We'll fight the heathens and the ghost enemy

This is the prophecy
This is the prophecy

I see the money beggars on the last temptation
We're marching now through the devastation
I'm with the prophets on a misson of salvation
Cities falling, nations falling nations
