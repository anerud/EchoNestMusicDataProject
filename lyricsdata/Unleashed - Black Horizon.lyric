8. Black Horizon

Towards a black horizon
Our brothers are avenged, the battle is won
The longships set sail in the night
On raging sea, with stars as guide
Thoughts of those we could not save,
The wounds i received and blows i gave
The darkness before my eyes
The Freezong wind that chills my spine

Black Horizon...
Towards a black horizon
...
