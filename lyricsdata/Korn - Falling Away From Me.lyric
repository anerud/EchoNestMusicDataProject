Hey, I'm feelin' tired
My time is gone today
You flirt with suicide
Sometimes that's okay
Do what others say
I'm here standing hollow
Falling away from me
Falling away from me

The day is here, fading
That's when I'm insane
I flirt with suicide
Sometimes kill the pain
I can always say
It's gonna be better tomorrow
Falling away from me
Falling away from me

Beating me down
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground
Screaming some sound
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
...
