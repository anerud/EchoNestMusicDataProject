"Baby Love, I think its time now
to share with you these feelings that I'm feeling now
its been three years since I've known you
nothing but happiness since I've found you
its been a long time coming still going strong
through good and bad, we've been holding on
within my soul its been overdue
cause my hearts been wanting to ask you

chorus:
will you be mine on this day
will you be the sunshine in rain
will you be the stars in my nights
will you be the joy, the joy in my life
will you be my everything
will you be the happy song i sing
will you be the love i cant deny
will you be the love, the love of all time
will you be mine
