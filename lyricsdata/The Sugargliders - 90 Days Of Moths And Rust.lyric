I don’t wanna hear what’s said
I don’t wanna see you dead
Is this season worth retrieving
I know I’ll never ever go to believing
Until you make it up to me

Now it’s getting hard to take
And it’s getting hard to look
I can’t see beyond the next thing
But I’m never ever gonna give in
I’m only hanging around

Without you
High off the ground
