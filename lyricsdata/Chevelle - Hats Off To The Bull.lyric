All our needs put together
Don't bleed on their own
You paid for an eyeful
So behold the bull
Why can't I look up, out in the clearing
Tell me what's there below, end over end
While he's safe for the moment, guess what he's learning
He's never safe from the crowd

So hats off to the bull
No giving up
Either way, it makes ya mad
Well some of us
Hats off to the bull, keep giving all
What ya say we make amends

To be monumental
