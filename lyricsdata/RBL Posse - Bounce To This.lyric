[ Mr. Cee ]
Well, here's a little dose
From the half of the group you like the most
Straight from the Frisco City, West Coast
With somethin up my sleeve
It's just my pep talk about these niggas who be trippin
About these niggas who be trippin about these niggas, oh my God, they done failed
Each one of them's some victims with some jaws that got swelled
With a hard blow from the steel-toed boots
Cause mama always said, "Boy, put them feet to use"
And don't get mad cause we won't flip-flop
Cause RBL's just like a truck with no brakes, punk, it don't stop
Like Tony the Tiger you know our shit is like great
Cause we ain't comin corny like some of you Frosted Flakes

[ Black C ]
So meenie-meenie-meenie-moe
Should a nigga pick a hoe?
I think I squat to the house for the gat, I bring us back some indo
Pretend tho, if you wanna, I think I'm gonna
Step to the back and bust a cap
And watch yo 'real-ass' niggas scat
See, it be on on my block
We poppin a cop with a glock
Even them young niggas givin shots
We gives a fuck about a copper, gettin our propers
By burnin cops like? chopper
So ah - you can smoke an ounce to this (biatch)
While my niggas on the run smoke a stog and all bounce to this
