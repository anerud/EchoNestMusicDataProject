Floetry
Uh, it's floetic
Uh, it's floetic
Uh, it's floetic
Uh, it's floetic
Uh, it's floetic
Yo

Floetry, we're alright,
I'm the floecist and I'm alright,
She's the songstress and she's alright

I say what's up, what's up with you,
You feelin' good, we feel it too.
We're gonna mess now, said with this groove.
I'll step on one, you step on two.

Now when we move, we feelin' the vibe, right?
Said if we move, we're makin' a vibe, right?
And if it's day or if it is night,
We're feelin' alright, said we be alright, alright.
What?

Oh, you let your body move.
Feelin' it inside you. (Inside you)
Let your body move, I said now. (One more time say)

You let your body move,
I'm feelin' it inside you.
We can get it in, that's what's up.

Floetry and we're alright,
I'm the floecist and I'm alright,
She's the songstress and she's alright.

Floetry, alright,
I'm the floecist and I'm alright,
...
