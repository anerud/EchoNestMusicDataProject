Listen baby donâ? t even waste your tears on an insensitive man
Thereâ? s a better place for you
I mean what you really need is someone who cares
Someone whoâ? s gonna be there for you, someone like me
Someone with sensitivity

Girl, I know it's been hard since he went away
And left you so sad you cry everyday
Let me kiss your tears erase all your doubts
Because for you Iâ? m here, you won't be without love

Don't need a man thatâ? ll give you money
Come on let me show you just what you need honey (I got what you need)
You donâ? t need a man thatâ? ll treat you wrong
You need a man with sensitivity (a man like me)

Someone who can love you
Someone who will need you
