I don't wish you no bad luck baby
i don't wish you no strain
i only want to expose your life to
the finer things
i offer you my company girl
you don't need no sympathy, just me
some one who cares
Refrain
whatever you want
girl you know i can provide
whatever you need (whatever you need baby)
call six three two twenty-one three five
Now maybe i should drive right over
show you my new ride
