iwill be there for the wake up
to take you back with me
i will wake up with a smile just for you

CHORUS
i will be ther for the wake up
to take you back with me
and i'll wake up with a smile just for you

i see the pictures on the t.v
there not half as good as you
and i like the silly things that you do
