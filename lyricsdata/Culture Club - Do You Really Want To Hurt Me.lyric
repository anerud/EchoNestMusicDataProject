Give me time
To realize my crime
Let me love and steal
I have danced inside your eyes
How can I be real

Do you really want to hurt me
Do you really want to make me cry

Precious kisses, words that burn me
Lovers never ask you why
In my heart the fire's burnin'
Choose my color find a star
Precious people always tell me
That's a step, a step too far

Do you really want to hurt me
