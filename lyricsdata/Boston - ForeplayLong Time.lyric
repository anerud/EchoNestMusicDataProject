[Foreplay]

[Instrumental]


[Long Time]

It's been such a long time
I think I should be goin', yeah
And time doesn't wait for me
It keeps on rollin'

Sail on, on a distant highway, yeah
I've got to keep on chasin' a dream
I've gotta be on my way
Wish there was something I could say

(Well, I'm takin' my time) I'm just movin' on
You'll forget about me after I've been gone
(And I take what I find) I don't want no more
It's just outside of your front door
