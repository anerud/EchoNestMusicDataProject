Oh Nicki, you so fine
Oh Nicki, you so fine you blow my mind
Hey Nicki!
Hey Nicki!

Jamaican, Queens, about to catch a flight
I'll be there... 6 o'clock tomorrow night
Jump off the flight, hit the hotel
Jump in the shower, I'm musty as hell

Unload my bags, pull out the doser
Jackin' off, to this Nicki Minaj poster
Thinking about her, all on the highway
'Fore I bust a nut, I yell "pink friday"
