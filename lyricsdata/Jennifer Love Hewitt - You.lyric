Hold me now
Stop the morning light from breaking
Something's coming over me
Don't know what it is I'm saving

The clock ticks by
And it just might change everything
If I don't give you all that's waiting
Who knows what tomorrow will bring

If I try not to need you
I'll be hiding from myself but, oh

If tomorrow never comes
I would do it all again
If the light never breaks through
I would stay until the end
