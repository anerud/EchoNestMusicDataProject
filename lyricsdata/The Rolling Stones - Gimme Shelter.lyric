Yeah, a storm is threatening
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Lord, I'm gonna fade away

War, children
it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children
it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Oh, see the fire is sweepin'
At our streets today
Burnin' like a red coal carpet
A mad bull lost its way
