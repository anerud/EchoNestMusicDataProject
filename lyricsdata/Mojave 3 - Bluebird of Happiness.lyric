gotta find a way to get home strong
gotta find a way back home

gotta find a light to guide me along
gotta find a way back home

running for your life won't get you so far
running for your life so far

gotta find a road to bring me home slow
gotta find a way back home

gotta find a road to bring me home slow
gotta find a way back home

the loving in your eye that holds you alive
gotta find a way back home

gotta find a way to get home strong
gotta find a way back home

gotta find a road that brings me back slow
gotta find a way back home
