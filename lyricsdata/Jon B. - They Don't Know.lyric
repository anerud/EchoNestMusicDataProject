Heard about my past
Things I used to do
The games I used to play
The girls that didn't last
I know what's on your mind
You think I'm doing wrong
Can I say what is real
You are the only one
When I'm not around
Do you think of me
Or what the jealous ones
Are claiming me to be
You should know by now
That it's gonna take
A lot of trust from you
For us to make it through

You should know baby you're my angel
Nothing's gonna make you fall from heaven
Girl I just want to love you Love you

Don't listen to what people say
They don't know about you and me
