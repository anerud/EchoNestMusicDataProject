Na-na-na-na, na-na, na
Na-na-na-na na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na, na
Na-na-na-na na-na

I guess I just lost my husband
I don't know where he went
So I'm gonna drink my money
I'm not gonna pay his rent
(Nope!)

I got a brand new attitude
And I'm gonna wear it tonight
I'm gonna get in trouble
I wanna start a fight

Na-na-na-na, na-na, na
I wanna start a fight
Na-na-na-na, na-na, na
I wanna start a fight!

So, so what?
I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't need you

And guess what
I'm having more fun
And now that we're done
I'm gonna show you tonight

I'm alright
I'm just fine
And you're a tool

So, so what?
I am a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight
