In these depths of desperate despair,
We bring down judgment from the sky with prayers!
I drank till the waters turned whiskey rye,
I drank till the waters run dry!
Don't be the one to come knocking at my door,
Hell no, I won't pick you up off the floor!
Don't come here with blood in your filthy mouth,
I wasn't there when the deal went south!

You sold me out
I sold myself in,
I picked up the claw!
You dealt me out,
I dealt myself in!
