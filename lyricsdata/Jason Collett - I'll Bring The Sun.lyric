You took hold of my affections
With your Bible and your sword
Your celebrity connections
I was not used to keeping score
From your fine guilded chalice
I drank all your cheap red wine
It was a good place to play Judas (Judas)
Hiding pearls from the swine

I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun to you when I come
