I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
Get yours

[mc breed]

Smooth as a wanna be, for quickly you a gonna be
{o thats the way it is}
F**k yea and thats the way it's gonna be
Why, puffin on a dank and drinking mad brew
Taking names and after that I'm kickin ass too.
Breed, kinda of tha{can I get a ryhme to go}
Hey yo pac ill set back and design it slow.
They hate to see a young nigga, come up
Another punk, run up
And have to get his, gun up
Cause um I ain't takin no shorts, like a newport, explortin the fully joint and
Explodin on the whole court.
And I don't wanna be, wanna be, nuttin like mike
Cause even mike don't miss every itty bitty triflin
And when you in the spotlight, you get um jocked right
But your lifes not tight.
Buckin anybody forbed mine
When will they relize, im set out to get mine

I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
Get yours

I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
Get yours

I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
Get yours

I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
Get yours

I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
Get yours

I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
Get yours

[2pac]

I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
Finga on the trigga, nigga, hand on my nine
Smokin blunts a skunk, makin hoes of punks
