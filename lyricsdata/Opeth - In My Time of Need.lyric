I can't see the meaning of this life I'm leading
I try to forget you as you forgot me
This time there is nothing left for you to take,
This is goodbye

Summer is miles and miles away
And no one would ask me to stay

And I should contemplate this change
To ease the pain
And I should step out of the rain
Turn away
