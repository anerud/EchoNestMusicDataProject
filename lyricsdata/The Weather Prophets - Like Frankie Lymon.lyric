Your love pours into me
Pour me a cup and fill it up, fill it up.
You enclose me, you're my tortoise shell
You're my coat in the rain

With you I could dance all night
You make me want to say things like squeeze me tight
You make me think of all the good things
You make me want to smile
And try and sing like Frankie Lymon
Sing like Frankie Lymon

I lived with hatefulness I put up with fear
