Primitive love, I want what it used to be
Primitive love, no more in love, it's all a hustle
What's done is done, now it's my turn to have some fun
You're much too sly, don't give me alibis
I don't wanna know, I don't want to know

Primitive love
I want what it used to be, I want it
Primitive love, primitive love
I want what it used to be
I want what it used to be
Primitive love I want, I need, primitive love
