Arriving in an unknown town, 
Just trying to find a calm place
For me and my worst dependence, 
Feed the holes... overdose
No need to hide my intentions, 
Getting drunk and stoned as hell
The gin was just a part of it
Feed the holes... overdose

Killer stuff and liquid devil, 
Grinding sound for insane people
Haunts my brain, out of control, 
Feed the holes... overdose
Then I saw this gorgeous girl
With green eyes she looked so nice
...
