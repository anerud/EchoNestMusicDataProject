All my bags are packed and im ready to go
I'm standing here outside the door
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye

But the dawn is breaking its early morn
The taxi's waiting he's blowing his horn
Already I'm so lonesome I could die

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
