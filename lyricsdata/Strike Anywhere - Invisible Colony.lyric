The blood for your freedom
The horror that you taught to them
To kill all your sheep in the fold
Your power fades without control

Privacy invasions
The press dilates
A glamorous, divisible United States
Blown apart

The blood
For your freedom
The horror
That you taught to them
To kill
All your sheep
