Hello, it's me, your only son
Writing to you now because I haven't seen you in so long
Even though we live in the same home
You're the father that I've never known
I get up each day, you're already gone
Drive past your office late at night
And see the light still on
Why do you care more about your job
Than about the family falling apart?

Don't even know you
Can't understand you
Never stopped to think of anyone else
...
