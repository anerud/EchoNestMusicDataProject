I wanna know what you wanna do, what if I could say there wasn't any rules
I wanna play, play around, tell me if you think that you can get down
'Cause this is what I'm dying for
I mean, this is what I'm dying to do

Come here baby, I'm ready to touch you
Listen baby, nothing's too much
When I'm ready to play, I'm ready to play
Come here let me whisper in your ear
