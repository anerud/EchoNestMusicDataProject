Nuclear warheads detonate overhead*
Salted hydrogen bombs designed to destroy
Mutually assured destruction
Bodies incinerate in the initial blast
Building structures collapse into rubble
Firestorms burn through cities
And forests emitting vast amounts of smoke, soot
And dust into the troposphere
Driven by whirlwinds to form a black particle
Cloud belt encircling the northern hemisphere
...
