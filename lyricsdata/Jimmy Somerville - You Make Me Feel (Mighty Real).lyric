When we're up an' dancing on the floor, darling
And I feel like I need some more
And I feel your body close to mine
And I know my love it's about that time

Makes me feel mighty real
You make me feel mighty real
Well you've got me goin'
Like I knew you would
And the music's in me
And I feel real hot
Then you kiss me there
...
