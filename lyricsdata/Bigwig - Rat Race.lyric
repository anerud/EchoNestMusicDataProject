Excuse me citizen
What are you looking for? 
Is there something I can find for you?
I'll have your back to your dull reality in no time
But before you go
Is it freedom, is it love?
Forgiveness from your God Above
On and on and on I hear about the rat race
And I don't care to place
Its always on your mind
You say it doesn't matter
Withstand the test of time
Always focused never scattered
Maybe I am missing something
Someone please just fill me in
All this greed and competition
