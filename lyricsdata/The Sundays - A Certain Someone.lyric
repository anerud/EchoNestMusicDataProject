Live your life, have your say
Read your stars, day by day
If I could have anything in the world for free
I wouldn't share it with anyone else but me
Oh, live your life, go your way
And I said oh no

Live your life, stake your claim
Wash your clothes, change your name
Ooh, and I said oh, no, no
If I could have anything in the world for free
I wouldn't share it with anyone else but me
