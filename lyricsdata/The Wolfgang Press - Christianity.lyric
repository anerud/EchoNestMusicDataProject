When the walls of Christianity begin to shake
When my life is in the balance, neither peace nor morals wake
Telling me my life is easy, debauched and thirdly heaven sent
My heart was never theirs but this Christianity will decide

I'm bruised and left alone
I get to feel so sad
People say that I was sad
People say that I was bad
People walking around with other feelings they never like to contemplate
Reacing out for love but would never say
The chirches have a network leading to the sect and to the soul
They levitate their founder's faith up to a higher ground while we stay home

I am a wicked man
