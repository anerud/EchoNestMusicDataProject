hello darkness, come on in
let me light a candle
imaginations running
hands start to tremble
knows enough to know not to believe
what is real, and what it seems to be
knows what's keeping him from being free
right outside your door

don't run away,
red headed stepchild
I can only promise you won't
find your way back home
