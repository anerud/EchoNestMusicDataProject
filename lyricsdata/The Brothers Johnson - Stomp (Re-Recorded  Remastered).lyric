Stepping out
The weekend's open wide
Fill it up, let's
Blast the jams and ride

While we're cruising
Around in the street
Listen up for the partying feet
Slap me five, that's the place
We've arrived, it's alive

Everybody, take it to the top

We're gonna stomp all night
In the neighborhood
Don't it feel all right
We're gonna stomp all night
Wanna party 'til the morning light

Running, running, running
...
