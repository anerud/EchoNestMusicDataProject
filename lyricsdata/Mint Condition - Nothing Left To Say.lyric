The words so strong
At least at the beginning
Who wouldve thought
There'd ever be an ending
We had it all
But it's like we've run into a wall

Now we try to talk
But just end up fighting
Try making up
But there's just no denying
Jus' ain't the same no more
What are we putting ourselves through all this for

You talk and hear me
But you can't communicate
Cause you're not lis'ning
Know these are two differnt things
Now I see what it means to have been
Blinded by the one you love so deeply
Cause,

The very things that make me love you
Are the things pushing me away (now)
In tears we stand here
With nothing left to say

And all I could do for you
I should've done before (now)
