I'll protect you, don't be scared
No matter what I will be there
I'll be gentle, I'll be light
These are the words you whispered in the night

Here I am

Now I'm standing in the cold
Everything is said and done
Atomic winter in my soul
From the absence of the sun
The only remedy I know
Is I got to let you go

Here I am
Here I am

But where were you when I was scared
A broken promise left me here
A post-it note is what I've got
