Oo yeah
I've been doing my own thing
Love has always had a way of having bad timing
But to my great surprise, ever since I looked in your eyes
I had one question for you
Tell me if you want me to give you all my time
I wanna make it good for you 'cause you blow my mind
I promise, boy, that I'll be true, you're the perfect find
So tell me if you want me to, yeah
If you've thought I'd sleep on this
Boy, you're wrong 'cause all I dream about is our first kiss
And you're the first one to make me feel like this
And this is one opportunity that I can't miss, no, no
