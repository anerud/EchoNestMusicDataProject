If you find yourself standing
At the end of your line
Looking for a piece of something
Maybe a piece of mind
Fed up, lost, and run down
Nowhere to hold on
Tired of, take your place at the end son
We'll get to you one by one

No light ever shines
Dead end tears that dry
Maybe a waste of words and time
Never a waste of life

Every hour will be spent
Filling a quota, just getting alonghandcuffs hurt worse
...
