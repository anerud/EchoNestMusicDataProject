I sit
Biting
On the
End of my pen
Chewing
It up
Just like
It was your head

I'm running away from here:
Shot to pieces, shot to pieces
Have nothing to say from here:
Shot to pieces, shot to pieces
Going my own way from here:
Shot to pieces, shot to pieces
Just leave me alone
(leave me alone)
Just leave me alone
(leave me alone)
Just leave me alone
...
