I wanted to know, who you really are
I needed the chance
To stitch up my scars
I'm closer to you
Than I was in the start
Come dive right in
And tear me apart

I'm trapped and we can't get along
I thought that I was strong
We are so unstable
And then I'm strung up on your touch
But I won't give you up
We are so unstable
