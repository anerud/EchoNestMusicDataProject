I've seen you hanging 'round
This darkness where I'm bound
And this black hole I've dug for me
And silently within
With hands touching skin
The shock breaks my disease
And I can breathe

And all of your weight, all you dream
Falls on me, it falls on me
And your beautiful sky, the light you bring
Falls on me, it falls on me

Your faith like the pain
...
