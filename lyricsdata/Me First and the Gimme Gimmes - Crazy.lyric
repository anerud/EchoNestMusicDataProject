A man decides after seventy years,
That what he goes there for, is to unlock the door.
While those around him criticize and sleep, criticize and sleep
And through a fractal on a breaking wall,
I see you my friend, and touch your face again.
Miracles will happen as we trip, happen as we speak,
happen as we speak

But we're never gonna survive, unless
We get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive, unless
We are a little Crazy
