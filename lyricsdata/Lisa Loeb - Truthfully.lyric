This isn't what I like to call flattery,
but I know that I believe that I've found what's true,
that I've found what's you.

Truthfully I
I'm finding finally.
Truthfully you
you helped me find at last.
Truthfully we
are finding out what's true.
And Truthfully I am finding out what's you.

Surprise, cause I was flying the plane.
Surprise, cause now I'm smiling again.
