I don't mind you comin' here
And wastin' all my time
'Cause when you're standin' oh so near
I kinda lose my mind

It's not the perfume that you wear
It's not the ribbons in your hair
I don't mind you comin' here
And wastin' all my time

I don't mind you hangin' out
And talkin' in your sleep
It doesn't matter where you've been
As long as it was deep, yeah

You always knew to wear it well and
You look so fancy, I can tell
...
