Uh well uh you might think I'm crazy
To hang around with you
Or maybe you think I'm lucky
To have somethin' to do
But I think that you're wild
Inside me is some child

You might think I'm foolish
Or maybe it's untrue
(You might think I'm crazy)
You might think I'm crazy
(All I want is you)
But all I want is you

You might think it's hysterical
But I know when you're weak
You think you're in the movies
