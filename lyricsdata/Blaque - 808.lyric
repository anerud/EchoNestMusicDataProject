See what I beleive is
We was granted the power
Whats that the power to what
The power to make u dance
(like this)

I heard shes got a 9 to 5
But coming in after 12
I know your tired of her lies
Just let her go whats the deal
Now take me for instance babe
See my love will drive you crazy

Cause I'll be going boom like an 808
Be makin circles like a figure 8
You know it feels good from head to toe
Now hold on to me baby here we go
