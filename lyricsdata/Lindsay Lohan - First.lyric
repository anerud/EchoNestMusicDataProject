Is that someone you used to date?
Why's she hanging around here, what's her story?
Doesn't she know that it's too late?
That the party is over and the car is for me

Why don't you tell her what's been goin' on?
'Cause she seems to be dreamin' instead of just leavin'
If you don't have the heart to fill her in
Then just step aside and let me lay it on the line

'Cause you're mine
And tonight you don't revolve around her
You're mine
And this time I'm gonna scream a little louder

Don't wanna be like
Every other girl in the world
Like every other one who wants you
'Cause when I see you, something inside me burns
And then I realize I wanna come first
...
