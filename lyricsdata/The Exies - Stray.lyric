left alone with empty hands
Losing you is more than i can stand, i can't mend
Close my eyes, and made a wish
To lose myself so i'll forget about you
it's no use

Swore to never ever leave you
To never let you out of my hands
Nothing here could ever change this
A promise til the living end
I swore i'd never stray from you

Broken bones, broken in half
I've come too far to start again
But i'm trying, i am trying
I'm sick of this, i'm sick of hurt
...
