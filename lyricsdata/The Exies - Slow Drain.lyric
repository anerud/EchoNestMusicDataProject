Yeah, I'm nameless, nameless
Love found me lost
But then I'm thankful, thankful righting the wrongs
Forgotten blessings, blessings down on my knees
My soul is endless, endless but
I'm so relieved and I'm so relieved and I'm so relieved

But if you must be concerned
I'm on a slow drain now
As you watch me burn
I'm on my way back down
If you must be concerned
I'm on a slow drain
