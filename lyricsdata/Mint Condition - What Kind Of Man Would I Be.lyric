You know
We can't do this
We just can't
Listen
You say you feel disenchanted
'Cause lately he takes you for granted
Still faithful and true you've remained
And to her, so have I
You pour out your heart and I listen
And we catch a vibe reminiscin'
Temptation so strong not to mention
The yearning inside
But what kind of man would I be
If I lived unfaithfully
And what kind of girl would you be
If you did the same
'Cause I don't wanna see her cry
