Something hiding behind me 
Something hiding behind me 
I know what do you think of me 
Tripping the line stuck in the mud 

Somebody in my lane 
Who who who I said freak 
Somebody in this place 
Has been put out to grass 
I said it could be you 
The ghost in my life 

I WONT LIE I WONT HATE I WONT CRY I WONT SHAKE 
I'M THE GHOST IN THE WAY 

You sold me down the river, my friend 
You said you were my best friend, never again 
...
