Don't act surprised
'cause you realize
nothing's meant to last
You're going way too fast
Count to ten, I'm turning back again
and my life has gone too fast
If your heart is going to crack,
fall apart like that
Did you ever guess
someone could keep this mess
No, you can't have it back

See me shimmer in the night
like a firefly, burning bright
shimmer, baby, shimmer
for your love

Well, I say
