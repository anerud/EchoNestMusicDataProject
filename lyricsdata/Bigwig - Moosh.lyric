We sat on a curb after a party
And I'll never forget how she looked at me so sweet
We traded thoughts we traded secrets
And I never thought I'd ever find
A girl that made me so complete

I can remember the taste of our first kiss
I can't remember a time I felt like this
She don't care that I'm always broke
And she always laughs at my dumb jokes
