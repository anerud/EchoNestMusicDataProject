I'll send you a letter
From the front line
Please send applause
And some good advice
You were born with a compass
A map on your table
Tell me how did you find out
Your bearings were wrong

Just pray for us
Pray for sunshine
These days are cold
And I'm missing you
The city is no place to loose
Ah but I never thought
I could choose
It was plain from the start
Plain from the start
I was playing for time
