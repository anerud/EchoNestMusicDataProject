Why can't I explain my feelings?
All these thoughts my mind's just reeling,
Confused and dumb in my regrets,
Hope it's not too late yet.

I miss you yes it's true,
it's been two months since I'm the fool,
Don't know what's keeping me from you.

Well, it's hard to explain what I've done wrong,
New adjustments, it's been so long.
