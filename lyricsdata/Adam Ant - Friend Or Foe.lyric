I want those who get to know me
To become admirers or my enemies

Take it up or leave it
I'm not gonna change a bit
If it means heartache
Then leave it out for your sake
I tried and I try tried
To take care of my insides
Nobody's perfect so leave me if you object

I want those who get to know me
To become admirers or my enemies
I want those who get to know me
To become admirers
