Momma
I know you said you wanted a record that you could listen to
With no cussing and shit, I tried, but I still gotta do this
Jingle jingle we've go the lingo
With so much heat it's hard for us to pick the first single
It don't matter 'cuz I'm underground anyway
Rich balling, bitch call and fly any day
You dirty niggas y'all too whack to dance
Y'all need to ease up off that now before y'all splint y'all pants
And leave that up to my niggas, young fly niggas
Getting down you and I niggas don't try niggas
I changed my mind I don't want your bitch
'Cuz sorry ass women just don't get rich
You could keep her I'd rather have a Fifi bag because it's cheaper
You can't come up for NL, I gets deeper
And my hold is so cold, it's a sleeper
So pass the reafer
And to you false balling niggas just grab your crotches
But if you paid nigga pat your pockets
And for sure, you've got yours
I've got mines and we're balling
So call up everybody
Let's pitch in ona party for sure
You've got yours
I've got mines and we're balling
So call up everybody
Let's pitch in ona party for sure
Alright somebody play the potato salad let's take a ballad
