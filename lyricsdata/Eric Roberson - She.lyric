I woke up, reached over and noticed that she's not here 
If last night was a dream, then life is so unfair 
I dug my head in the pillow and suddenly smelled her hair 
As I heard her footsteps coming back up the stairs

She reminds me that it's alright 
She reminds me that I'm alive 
She  reminds me that it's ok 
...
