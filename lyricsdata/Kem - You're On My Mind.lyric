I come running back to you
And lay it all on the line
Coz ain't nothing left to lose
Talking bout a love of a lifetime
And we pride ourselves enough
We can believe our life
Baby love is on the run
Girl don't you know
That you can't hide

We can find our way babe
I need you beside me
Hear me when I say girl
...
