1, 2, 3, go
Broken, yeah, you've been livin'
On the edge of a broken dream
Nothing, yeah, that's the only thing
You'll ever take away from me

I'm never gonna stop
Ain't never gonna drop
Ain't no different than it was before
So take some good advice
You'd better stop and think twice
'Fore you take your first step out that door

If you wanna step up (step up)
You're gonna get knocked down (knocked down)
If you wanna step up (step up)
You're gonna get knocked down
You had your chance to walk away
Live to see another day
If you wanna step up (step up)
You're gonna get knocked down(knocked down)
You're gonna get knocked down
