Why destroy every sacred sign
Breathe smoke swallow tainted water
We rise trample the earth with heavy awkward feet
And nothing happens fast enough for the men of the industry

Small minds ignore the dangers
Trust ourselves with imperfect strangers
Like rats as we scurry up the sails
Weak winds seem to suck up softly
And loose lips sink a fleet of longing
...
