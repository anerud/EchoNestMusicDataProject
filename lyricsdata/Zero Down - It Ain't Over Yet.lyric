I may be getting old but I'm far from out of angst
because the problems that I face on the day to day don't go away.
Life it ain't so civilized when it comes down to survive
and I've had the ones that I thought as family push me to the side.
I'm still in debt I can't pay my rent, my teeth are rotting in my head.
I may be getting old, but it ain't over yet.
I got so much left to say, I can't believe I'm here again
...
