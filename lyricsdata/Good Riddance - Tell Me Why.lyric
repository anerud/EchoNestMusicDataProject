To those in power it's always the same
Made so resistant to reason
Why just deny all the voices for change
As we stumble and fall stripping the process away

So who stands to gain from the righteous refrain
They say you get what you pay for
So we breach one more soul toss them out on the dole
Our shroud of indifference belies our benevolent tones
