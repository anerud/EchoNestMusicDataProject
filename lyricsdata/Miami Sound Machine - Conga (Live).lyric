Come on, shake your body baby,
do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on, shake your body baby,
do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer.

Come on, shake your body baby,
do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you've tried it
Do the conga beat

Everybody gather 'round now
let your body feel the heat.
Don't you worry if you can't dance
let the music move your feet.
It's the rhythm of the island
and like sugarcane, so sweet.
