So many times you could have walked away
But I didn't have to say a word to convince you to stay
'Cause you know it and I know this thing is real
So we continue to learn and our love grows deeper still

Each day I watch you get better at this
Each moment I'm more and more convinced
We trust in love, we took the risk
We ran our own pace, we won our race
And I could never turn away

We've come so far
Stars look up at you, baby
My heart belongs
Right here next to you, baby

If I had just one wish it would be to stay together
Stay together, let's grow together
...
