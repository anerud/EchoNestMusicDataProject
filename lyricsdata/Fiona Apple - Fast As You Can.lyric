I let the beast in too soon
I don't know how to live without my hand on his throat
I fight him always and still
Oh darling it's so sweet
You think you know how crazy
How crazy I am
You say you don't spook easy
You won't go, but I know
And I pray that you will

Fast as you can
Baby run, free yourself of me
Fast as you can

I may be soft in your palm
But I'll soon grow hungry for a fight
And I will not let you win
My pretty mouth will frame the phrases that will
Disprove your faith in man
...
