Why are you the one

I can't lose

What's the reason that I'm here again it's crazy
I keep waiting but I'm foolish cause you'll never change
Wasted all my time and here I am still crying over you
Over you

Loving you was so hard
(But I keep Trying Baby)
I just end of with scars
(Cause I keep fighting Baby)
Loving you is like a battle that I can't afford to lose
I can't lose

But I'm asking you
Why are you the only thing that I care about
Why are you the only thing that I care about
Why are you the only thing I think about
Why are you the only one

Baby you're no good for me, no
You can be, You can be, You can, You can be the only one
