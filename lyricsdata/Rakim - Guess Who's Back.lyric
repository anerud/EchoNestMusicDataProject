New York City, whaddup? Ya'll ready or what?
Check, I think they ready now, baby

It's the return of the Wild Style fashionist
Smashin' hits, make it hard to adapt to this
Put pizazz and jazz in this, and cash in this
Mastered this, flash this and make 'em clap to this

DJ's throw on cuts and obey the crowd
Just pump the volume up and play it loud
Hip-hop's embedded, before I said I wouldn't let it
But me and the microphone is still magnetic

Straight off the top, I knew I'd be forced to rock
Dance floors just stop, the spot's scorchin' hot
Hopin' I open Rakim Allah seminars
Massage at the bar, smokin' ten dollar cigars

While I admire midas, with more vision than TV's
