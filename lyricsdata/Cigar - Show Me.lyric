You told them all you'd do it
And sure enough you've done it
But was your reasoning
Just to prove them wrong

Your words are thick black smoke
But to you it doesn't matter
Just fan those flames uncontrolled

Mister show me the words
Just how far will you go?
Show me the words
Just how far will you go?
