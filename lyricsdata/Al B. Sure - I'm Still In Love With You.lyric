Spending my day
Thinking bout you, girl
Being here with you
Being near to you
I can't explain myself

Why I feel like I do
Though it hurts me so
To let you know

When I look in your eyes
Just let me know how you feel
Let me know if love is really real

It seems to me
That I'm wrapped up in your love
...
