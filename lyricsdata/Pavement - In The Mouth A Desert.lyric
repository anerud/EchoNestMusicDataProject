Can you treat it like an oil well
When it's underground, out of sight?
And if the site is just a whore-sign
Can it make enough sense to me?

Pretend the table is a trust-knot
We'll put our labels down, favors down
I'll watch a yarn of twine unravel
And you'll never get it back

It's what I want (it's what I want)
It's what I want (twine comes down)
It's what I want (it's what I want)
Don't you know
I could make a try
