Oil remove shred and tear radiation vapour air
It's the fear so unclear man in motion going nowhere
In our homes stuck in the face spread the word to the populace
Yellow journal yellow journal set the pace feel the rage
Manifestations of a sort so insidious off the point
Simple solution never confusion sport a gun kill a cop
Crazy world of weary thought so receive me had enough

Lock me up
Lock me up
