Ladies and Gentlemen

Ya ya ya, ya ya ya
Whoo
Ya ya ya, ya ya ya

VERSE
Everyone can see we're together
As we walk on by
And we fly just like birds of a feather
I won't tell no lie
All of the people around us they say
Can they be that close
Just let me state for the record
We're giving love in a family dose

CHORUS
We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family (we are family)
