Sky cracks open
The walls falling through the floor
Just as well to keep it
A guessing game in store

You're with me now, will be again
Other points in between
And the cruel, cruel mornings
Turn to days of swim or sink

If living right is easy, what goes wrong
You're causing it to drown
Didn't want to turn that way
You're causing it to drown

Doesn't make a difference now
You're causing it to drown
...
