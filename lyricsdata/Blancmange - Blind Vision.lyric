Blind hope, blind visions
Blind centre, one centre
Blind living and seeing
Blind hell, blind hell

Blind visions and no reasons
For action, blind words
Blind visions and no reasons
For action, blind words

Blind visions and no reasons
No reasons for actions
In a dream when I'm reading pages full of words
The harder you look
It's getting hard, it's getting hard, it's not
...
