Blue you radiant blue
I don't know how you can stand next to me
You you talk like a noose
And only confuse my perplexity
Now that I'm so sad and not quite right
I could dance all night
I could dance all night

Shake your rattle-snake skin
And become a part of society
Wait on down the highway
To see how far I'll come a-run a-run
run running
...
