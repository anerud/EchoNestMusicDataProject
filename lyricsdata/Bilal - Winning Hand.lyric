Like a careling man, 
Who has no trace of luck 
I roam these streets on the wheel 
Till you came along 
Just like the light at the dawn 
With you on my side, lucky me 

A game change, I’m on the roll 
Dealer hit me again, 
Yeah we’re winning again, I’m on the roll 
Baby you’re winning hand 
A game change, I’m on the roll 
Hit me again, dealer hit me again 
Yeah we’re winning again, I’m on the roll
