Tired of laying in bed, listening to the water run
Ceiling's falling in, Baby's dress is covered in dust
So I don't care what it costs, Baby dust that old thing off
It's one more night in Brooklyn, Baby we're getting lost

I ain't taking you home, I found a little place that'll do
It'll never match the beauty of a Tennessee spring
But it's something new
