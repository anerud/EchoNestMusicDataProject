I know you're lying all alone
Waiting for my call
To tell me that your body's craving me
Well the phone's not enough tonight
Let's make this reality

(1) - We can do the things that you don't get to do
Cause you lay all alone
Just let me sit here and watch you strip
For me cause I know I get you off
