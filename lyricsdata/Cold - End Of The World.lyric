Everyone came around here
Everyone else got sick
And watched the clock tickin' slowly
Everyone knew the ending
Opened a bag of tricks
And stumbled over their own

They blew minds away
Sort of the cripplin
Just like thunder
And it's gone today
I'm so happy that it's on

Well it's the end of the world
...
