Aww Yeah! Do You Wanna Ride wit Us (Who Ride Wit Us)
Aww Yeah! Do You Wanna Ride wit Us (Who Ride Wit Us)
Aww Yeah! Do You Wanna Ride wit Us (Who Ride Wit Us)
Aww Yeah! Do You Wanna Ride wit Us (Who Ride Wit Us)

(Daz)
When the six-tray bounce, the street scrapin the bumper
wit the sound for the summer that be thumpin and hummin
Hoppin Up the 'Shaw on a Sunday, What a Fun Day
Dip skip trippin and whippin down the one-way
Diggy Daz a busta ain't had enough against
Rough and Tough but its never to much
Daz Kurupt, Kurupt and Daz on that ass
We clash blast suckers just like a head on crash
This ain't back in the day, you get taught and sprayed
AK front to the back cause we hard to fade
We enormous, we attackin it plus we swarmmin
to Rumble in the Jungle like Ali and Foreman
We rippin it up, we be givin it up
On the daily homeboy we be givin it up
We be cuttin it up scufflin, mufflin it up
Homeboy Diggy Daz (Now With Kurupt)

Aww Yeah! Do You Wanna Ride wit Us (Who Ride Wit Us)
Aww Yeah! Do You Wanna Ride wit Us (Who Ride Wit Us)
Aww Yeah! Do You Wanna Ride wit Us (Who Ride Wit Us)
