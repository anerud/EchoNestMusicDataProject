To feel the same,

As you look into these eyes.
Did you ever think that you would be here?

Here, alone, for life.
To drag it down, when what you mean is to take control.
The failure that takes the hardest fall as you go.

I give this to you -- it's everything I'd ever have.
I'm falling into all these places that we had.
A few too late, nothing to do with it.
And when it's done, I put my face against your gun.
