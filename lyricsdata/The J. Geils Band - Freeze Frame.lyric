Freeze frame

I could see it was a rough-cut Tuesday
Slow-motion weekdays stare me down
Her lipstick reflex got me wound
There were no defects to be found
Snapshot image froze without a sound

Thursday morning was a hot-flash factor
Her face still focused in my mind
Doo-dloo-dloo
Test-strip proofsheet love is hard to find

Doo-dloo-dloo
Friday night, we danced the spotlight grind
Doo-dloo-dloo
Stop time heart for me if she's not mine
