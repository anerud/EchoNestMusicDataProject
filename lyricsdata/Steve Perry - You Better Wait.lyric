You Better Wait
(S. Perry, L. Brewster, P. Taylor, M. Lucas, J. Pierce, G. Hawkins)

She was only a child
Someone to hold on
Only a child
Someone to believe in
Only a child, someone to love
She was "17", beauty queen
I met her in a magazine
Heart of fire, Love's desire
Reachin' out, higher higher
Runaway, one more day
A broken hearted child at play
I pray for you, baby blue
In the name of love I reach for you
