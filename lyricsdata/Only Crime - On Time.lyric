Climbing on another one
Racing for the higher ground
We separate all the civil serenades
Into hollow sounds

And I'm yours
I'm waiting just behind your eyes
Weighed down a heavy heart
And a mind grown cold with lies

On time
Just when you get it
You brace yourself against the furthest fall
You'll never get it
...
