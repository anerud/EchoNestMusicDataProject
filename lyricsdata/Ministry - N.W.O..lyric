All the locals hide their tears of regret
Open fire 'cause I love you to death
Sky high with a heartache of stone
You'll never see me 'cause I'm always alone

I'm in love without a trace of dissent
I'll buy the torture 'cause you pay for the rent
Tied high with a broken command
You're all alone in the promised land
...
