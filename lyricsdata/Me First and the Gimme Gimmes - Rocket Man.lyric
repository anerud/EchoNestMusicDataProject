She packed my bags last night, pre-flight
Zero hour, nine a.m. and I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space on such a timeless flight

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
Touch down, brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
Touch down, brings me round again to find
...
