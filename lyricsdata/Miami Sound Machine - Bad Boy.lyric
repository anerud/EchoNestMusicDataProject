(Bad boy, bad boy, bad boy, bad boy)
(Boys will be boys, bad boy, bad boy
Boys will be boys, bad boy, bad boy)

(Boys will be boys)
Always get so restless
(Bad boy, bad boy)
(Boys will be boys)
Nothin' but trouble
(Bad boy, bad boy)

(Boys will be boys)
If you're feelin' breathless
(Bad boy, bad boy)
(Boys will be boys)
Nothin' but trouble
(Bad boy, bad boy)
