If that's not love, then what is?
if that's not friendship. then what is?
if that's not music, then what is?

we've got the music in our blood
magic seasons and the we're done
the magic feeling has begun
the magic feeling has begun

and before you know it we are there
on top of the world it seems
i don't now who or why or where
but i can still hear the music
...
