Hello it's me,
I've thought about us for a long, long time,
Maybe I think too much but something's wrong,
There's something here that doesn't last too long,
Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine.

Seeing you, or seeing anything as much as I do you,
I take for granted that you're always there,
I take for granted that you just don't care,
Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through.
