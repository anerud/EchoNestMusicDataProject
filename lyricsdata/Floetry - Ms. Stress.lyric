Oh baby

It's better that it hurts
It's better that it feels this way to me
I can't be too comfortable
'Cause loving you is not my destiny

Said I'm concerned that I feel this pain
My heart is aching, breaking
Pain staking in this gambling thing
This ain't no parallel universe, parallel life you choose to

In one your living like love of my life
And in the other your the daddy of theirs
So I play Russian Roulette and put this phone to my ear
Just to say, just to say yo this is Ms. Stress

It's better that it hurts
It's better that it feels this way to me
I can't be too comfortable
