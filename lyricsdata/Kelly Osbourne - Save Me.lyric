From the look in my eye, why didn't you just save me?
And all of my friends, Think I'm losing my mind.
I just can't believe I'm blinded by what I'd need,
It's like an empty space I need to fill the void.

When you looked in my eyes You knew I needed saving,
And when you saw me getting high Why didn't you come save me?

All of my life I've locked away my feelings,
