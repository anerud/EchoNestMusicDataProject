Kneeling down at my altar
The blood stains the walls
No need for conjecture
I pray for the world to fall

Pieces of my existence
In tiny stripes of flesh
Exposed emotions nerves bare
Rising mercury
What will become of this now
Where will this anger dwell
There will be no rapture
Only a blacker hell
...
