Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waitin' for a train
And I was feelin' near as faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
It rode us all the way into New Orleans
Now I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
And I was playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues, yeah
Windshield wipers slappin' time, I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew, yeah

Freedom was just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' and it's all there bubbling me
And feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
Listen up, feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee
