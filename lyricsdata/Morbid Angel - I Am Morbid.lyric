We stand defiant
In this great big ugly world
Do believe that the chaos
Was our one true calling
First we muscled fate
Then we brazenly call disorder
Watch the normals cower
They just can't take it anymore
Withstand together now
All the damning from on high
Fist horns are roaring forth
As I scream into the sky
I'm morbid
