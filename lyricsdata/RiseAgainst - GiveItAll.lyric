Break through the undertow, your hands I can't seem to find
Pollution burns my tongue, cough words I can't speak so I

Stop my struggling, then I float to the surface
Fill my lungs with air, then let it out

I give it all, this is the reason why I sing
So give it all, and it's these reasons that belong to me

Rock bottoms where we live, and still we dig these trenches
To bury ourselves in them, backs breaking under tension
