VERSE 1:

I can't believe it,
the way you look sometimes,
like a trampled flag on a city street.
Oh yeh.

And I don't want it,
the things you're offering me,
symilized barcode, quick I.D.
Oh yeh.

CHORUS:

'Cuz I'm a 21st century digital boy,
I don't know how to live, but i've got a lot of toys.
My Daddy's a lazy middle-class intellectual,
my Mommy's on Valium, so ineffectual.
Ain't life a mystery?
...
