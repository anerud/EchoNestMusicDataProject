Say it's true
Black and blue
I can share your situation
Keep hold on our
Emotions they
Will only make us cry

And you go
But I don't know
What you know
It ain't so serious anyway

When the clouds arrive we'll live on Ocean Drive

Don't know why
You're so blue
The suns gonna shine on everything you do
And the sky
...
