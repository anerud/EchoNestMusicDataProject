Welcome
You see, what we wanna talk about today
Is dimes that turn to pennies
Women that turn to bitches
Honeys that turn to hoes
I know y'all didn't know exactly what I'm talkin' about
Somebody gotta take their welfare cheque and go buy some weed
New outfit, do shit like that
Yo fella's, have your say
(Come on)

I used to see her at school
She always talked to the older dudes
The ones with nice clothes and all the shoes
 (I guess I shoulda knew)
She grew up fast in a short time
Older body but her actions showed a young mind
I mean this girl was so fine
Whoa, who would've known?

Who would have known?
She would have grown to become
 (Have grown, ohh)
(She's a, ahh)

Drug runnin', jeep jumpin'
 (Aaa)
Club frontin', know nothin'
 (Oh yea)
Dick suckin', smoke somethin'
Booster hustlin', dealer fuckin'
 (Calm down)
Roller duckin', street lovin'
Six children, no husband
Beauty queen
(Who would've known?)
(Who would've known?)

Drug running, jeep jumpin'
Club frontin', know nothing
Dick suckin', smoke something
Booster hustlin', dealer fuckin'
Roller duckin', street lovin'
Six children, no husband
 (I can do with you)
Beauty queen
(Who would've known?)
