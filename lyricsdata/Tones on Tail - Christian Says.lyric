Christian says everyone's to love him
Christian says just let go
Christian says you can't be happy being this way
Christian says he'll never let you go
Christian says he can't let you, let you run free
'Cause Christian says he needs you so

In this age of frozen freaks
The only highs we get are low
In this age of cold relief
Brings only what a way to go
