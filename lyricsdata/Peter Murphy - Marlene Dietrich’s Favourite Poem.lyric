My mother loved it so she said
sad eyed pearl and drop lips
glancing pierce through writer man
spoke hushed and frailing hips
her old eyes skim in creasing lids
a tear falls as she describes
approaching death with a yearning heart
with pride and no despise

Hot tears flow as she recounts
her favorite worded token
forgive me please for hurting so
don't go away heartbroken no
