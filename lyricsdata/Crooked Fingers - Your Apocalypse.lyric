In my dreams every time
your apocalypse is mine
With you 'live', with you 'die'
Keep you near me for all time to last the end of days
to never let you go

Draggin by, times a blur
saddest song I never heard
Softly played, sweet and low
Here's the love I never show you
cold that drifts away
Never to be known

And like a Great Lake draining
...
