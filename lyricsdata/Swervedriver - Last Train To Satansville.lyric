"You look like you've been losin' sleep"
Said a stranger on a train

I fixed him with an ice cold stare
And said "I've been havin' those dreams again"

In one dream there's this girl I know
And we dance every wakin' breath

And in the other they've thrown me in a cell
And they're tryin' me for her death

I'm only young and young in love,
As I hold that girl today
...
