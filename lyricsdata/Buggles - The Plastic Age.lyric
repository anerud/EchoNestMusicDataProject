Every day my metal friend
Shakes my bed at 6 a.m.
Then the shiny serving clones
Run in with my telephones

Talking fast I make a deal
Buy the fake and sell what's real
What's this pain here in my chest?
Maybe I should take a rest

They send the heart police to put you under,
Cardiac arrest
and as they drag you the door
They tell you that you've failed the test
...
