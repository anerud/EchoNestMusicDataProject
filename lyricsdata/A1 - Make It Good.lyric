When you're weary
when you're down and out
lay your hands on me

When you're weary
when you're down and out
lay your hands on me

I count my blessings
I think of all i have
she never thought about it
then threw it all away

Left it all a chance
she tore down fences
now it seems so wasted
wish she could turn back time

Now she's down on her knees to pray
begging please make it good
make it good somehow
she will do what it takes to change
someone please make it good
