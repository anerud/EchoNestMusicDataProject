Peace and love - a phoney kind of blubber
My instincts tell me to crash
You've got salt emissions and you know how to use them
I somesow think this won't last

So I'm moving south
To the great unknown
Yeah I'm moving south
Where the head unloads

You've got a reason
Some funky little demons
Telling me that life is a gas
You're a deconstruction a euphemism nothing
Motown gives it a blast

So I'm moving south
To the great unknown
