Barney: "I love you, you love me, we're a hap- ..."
(Four gunshots)
Little girl: "SHUT THE FUCK UP!"

"What do you wanna do with your life?"

Go on and take your best shot!
Blow them away! Blow them away!
Blow them away! Blow them away!

I don't know why
And, lately, I don't understand why the world's so blind
And no one seems to give a damn

Don't let them say that you can't be the things that you want.
