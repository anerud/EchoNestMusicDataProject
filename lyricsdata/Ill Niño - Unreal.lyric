Separate your mind
Overcome in time
I'm taking what is mine
Tenemos que pelear

Nothing is all, I thought I was there
I'm finding myself going nowhere
Is this a mistake?
I cannot relate to what is fake

Is this what I get for learning to speak?
For opening eyes and digging in deep?
Is this what I get for being reborn from the norm?

I don't want to shine; light will make us blind
I don't want to feel unreal
