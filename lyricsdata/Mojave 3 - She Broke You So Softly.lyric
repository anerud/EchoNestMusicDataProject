Were you bored of the laughter?
Were you tired of the pain?
Is the bond now broken?
Does nothing remain?

Shoulder to shoulder
Like two stones in a bag

Until there was nothing, yeah, nothing but dust?

But still you talk soft
So desperate and kind
So pure and so pointless
So helpless and blind

And is there no anger?
Just pills for the pain
