All the world is waiting
In the half life where we live
Nobody left to lead us
Our time is closing in

We'll take it back
Our time is closing in
So make it last
Our time is closing in

Living in apocalypse, closing in
From the streets to the towers where the air is thin
What does it take, take to survive
In the lumpen maze, how to get out alive
