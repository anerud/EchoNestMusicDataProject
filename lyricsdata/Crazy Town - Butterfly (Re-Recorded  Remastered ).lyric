Come my lady
Come, come my lady
You're my butterfly
(Sugar baby)
Sugar baby
Come my lady
Come, come my lady
You're my butterfly
(Sugar baby)
Sugar baby

Such a sexy, sexy, pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce
You got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your lovin' gets me high
So to keep you by my side
There's nothin' that I won't try

Butterflies in her eyes and the looks to kill
Time is passin'
I'm askin', could this be real
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal

I can feel too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up
When these times get rough
I was lost, now I'm found
Ever since you've been around
You're the women that I want
So yo, I'm puttin' it down

Come my lady
Come, come my lady
You're my butterfly
(Sugar baby)
Sugar baby
Come my lady
You're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy
(Crazy)

Come my lady
Come, come my lady
You're my butterfly
(Sugar baby)
Sugar baby
Come my lady
You're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy
(Crazy)

I don't deserve you
