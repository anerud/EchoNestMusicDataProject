You're my baby,
My love, my baby
All night
You make me
Want you
It drives me crazy
I feel like you were made just for me baby
Tell me if you feel the same way

Cause it just feels so right
I don't wanna waste no time
If I had to choose
I know I'm gonna always choose to be with you
Cause girl don't you know

Girl don't you know
You're so beautiful
I wanna give all my love to you girl
Not just a night
