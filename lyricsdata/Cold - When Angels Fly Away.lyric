I'll make a soldier's decision to fly away
Load my gun, paint my face, call me misery
I can see the sky light up and the ground explode
Got my sights locked down, I can see you breathe
Then I watched you fall and somebody scream
It's the saddest thing when angels fly away

I can't be home tonight
I'll make it back, it's alright
No one could ever love me half as good as you

Got a badge for my scars just the other day
