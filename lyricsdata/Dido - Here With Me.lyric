I didn't hear you leave
I wonder how am I still here
I don't want to move a thing
It might change my memory

Oh I am what I am
I'll do what I want, but I can't hide
I won't go, I won't sleep
I can't breathe, until you're resting here with me
I won't leave, I can't hide
I cannot be, until you're resting here with me

I don't want to call my friends
They might wake me from this dream
