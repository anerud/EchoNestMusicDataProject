Here we go, I'm hanging out in Camden
Drinking with my girlfriends on a Saturday night
This guy says, "come and meet my girlfriend"
She's sitting in the corner looking rather uptight

So I say "hello" and I try to be nice
But I see he's feeling itchy
Trying to play us off each other
"Girls, girls, please don't fight"
(You get the picture)

Hey you, the muscles and the long hair
Telling me that women are superior to men
Most guys just don't appreciate this
You just try convincing me you're better than them

So he talks for hours 'bout his sensitive soul
And his favourite subject is sex
I don't even think he really wanted it
But, Christ, this guy's too much

(I wanna tell him)
