Eyes on fire on you
Your presence is violation
Leave now or it's annihilation
It's best for both parties
If we just part
Eyes on fire on you
Take it with a grain of salt
Take it to the limit
Take the world by storm
Keep your head in
Take the gloves off
Take your life in your hands
Eyes on fire on you
