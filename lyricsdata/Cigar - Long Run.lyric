Sitting in the back row, preoccupied
While the world is spinning around him
He is locked up inside

And the one that they look to for answers
Holds the shackles as a threat
To the little boy of which requirements
This little boy he has not met

Thrown in a dungeon of confinement
That is devoid of the happiness
That would help this little boy
...
