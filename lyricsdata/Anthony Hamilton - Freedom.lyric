Feat. Elayna Boynton

Felt like the weight of the world was on my shoulders
.should I break or retreat and then return
Facing the fear that the truth, I discover
No telling how, all these will work out
But I’ve come to far to go back now.

Chorus:
I am looking for freedom, looking for freedom
And to find it cost me everything I have
Well I am looking for freedom, looking for freedom
And to find it, may take everything I have
...
