Oh, when it's god I see in headlights kneeling down on frozen highways
And salvation in white knuckles on a wheel
And the deer is in the audience by the border of the darkness
Where forgiveness grows and slowly winds away

Well there's a question somewhere asked with all the answers inside
But I'll never find the kid before she's gone
Well the day is never done, but there's a light on where you're sleeping
So I hope somewhere that troubles will be gone
