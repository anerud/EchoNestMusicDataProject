Ever feel like dying?
Ever feel alone?
Ever feel like crying?
Lost child in a store
Ever feel life pushing?
Shoving you away
Ever feel like breaking down?
Funeral in the rain

Feel like slipping away

Stand in the corner and scream with me
A body full of empty
A head that's full of rage - Better believe it
Stand in the closet and scream with me
A mind thats like a fire
Drivin by the pain - Better believe it

Ever feel like lying?
