The surface is so cold and worthless
All the things that I have still come from there
So paint the windows in front of my face
When you know damn well there's
No one behind them!

I wish your body was not so warm to me
I wish your body was not so warm to me
I wish your body was not so warm to me
Just so you know

And all it was was something beautiful
When tides and dreams don't seem so tall at all
And all it was was something beautiful
When tides and dreams don't seem so tall at all

It's me against the world, still I'm losing ground
And I'd kill to taste what it must be like
'Cause it's every one of my empty parts
That you fill, now
