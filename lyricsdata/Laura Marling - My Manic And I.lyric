He wants to die in a lake in Geneva
The mountains can cover the shape of his nose
He wants to die where nobody can see him
But the beauty of his death will carry on so
I don? t believe him

He greets me with kisses when good days deceive him
And sometimes we? re scorned and sometimes I believe him
And sometimes I? m convinced, my friends think I? m crazy
Get scared and call him but he? s usually hazy

At one in the morning, day is not ended
By two he is scared that sleep is no friend
And by four he will drink but he cannot feel it
Sleep will not come because sleep does not will it
And I don? t believe him, morning is mocking me

I? ll wander the streets, avoiding them eats
? Til the ring on my finger slips to the ground
A gift to the gutter, a gift to the city
