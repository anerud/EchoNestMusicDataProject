(What?)
Is that all you got to say?
(What? What?)
You're rubbing me the wrong way
(See your lips moving)
But I don't catch a word you say
(Shut up your chatter)
I need for you to go away

And all I hear is ay ya ya ya ya
You're talking way too much
I can't even hear me now
All your noise is messing with my head
You're in my head
Get outta my head

Outta my, outta my head
Want you outta my head
Outta my, outta my head
Get outta my head
Outta my, outta my head
Want you outta my head
Outta my, outta my head
That's what I said

(What?)
You looking at me for huh?
(Show me)
