[Chorus:]
Rappers sellin out for the money and fame
But I just keep on dune methane
Dee-dee-da-da-dee-dee-dane
I just keep on dune methane

[Casual]
They only know colonial ways
Anything that my homie okays
is all right these days
Display recklessness, whose tek is this
Pointed in the window of ya coupe Lexuses
Follow me on my Exodus
My poetics will earn the respect of thus
An individual crushing hypocritical nothings
Like aluminum cans
Put me on the mic and I'm doomin em
Operation: MC Intimidation
Occupation: rock the place then leave relieved
The masta John, large like a mastodon
In charge of the class Cas is on
Some whole new shit than you bastards on
Bitten my old style while smash was gone
My infallible flows will swallow you wholes
Rappin bout cars and clotes you need to kill it
