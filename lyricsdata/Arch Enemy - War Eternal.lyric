Friend or foe? 
There's no way to know
Through the battlefield of life
It's kill or be killed
So many times 
It's a matter of degree
From being up on your luck
To down on your knees

It's a hellish inferno
This is war eternal

They try to change you
Crush and break you
Try to tell you what to do
They'd like to have control of you
Back against the wall
...
