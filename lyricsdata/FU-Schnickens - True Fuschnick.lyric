I don't wanna grow up cuz I'm a True Fuschnick
We got a million styles that we compile
That we can play with
I'm a True what? I am a True Fushnick
Repeat 3X
So sit Buddah sit what lyrical styles should we kick?
I'm a rowdy roddy piper I flash my dread sherlock Holmes
The thicker the richer the bigger the dread
So I don't need no honeycomb
So eeney meeney miney mo good goobelly goo I bumped my toe
Oh-oh, "oh-oh better get Maoco" chocolate Chip's about to flow
The super the cola the fraja the listic expialadope Chip
When the mic is gripped in ridobidobip bip da be bong de dang, Bo!
Cuz worries and boderations when i raps it up again and again But not
with the same FU style I'm wicked and wild and versatile
When the mic is gripped by Chip you better believe it's worth your
while
Pause for the cause stop make way hurry up
Here I come come come
My lyrical styles are not to ifos nos in other words
They're not soft son rocks it rigade raggamuffin say it backwards
Aggarniffum so abra Fu alacazam run come follow me man
Put it by one phenomenon huminahumina I'm not done
Me-oh-me oh my hello hello hi
I'm not Huckleberry Finn I'm still speaking, shoo, fly
Don't bother i
So Fe hello hifi Fu fo, i make shapes with Pay-dough re me
Near far then I will stitch sew Lipton Tea bo Tae Kwon Do
Lyrics are bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling,
bubbling,*bubbling,*bubbling,*bubbling,*bubbling,*bubbling,*bubbling,
bubbling til' they're boiled
So don't drink the milk, Why? Cause it's rotten in other words it's
spoiled
So don't say drats, drats double or triple or quadruple drats
Me big and me black and me hot up de spot G jumping Jehosphats
