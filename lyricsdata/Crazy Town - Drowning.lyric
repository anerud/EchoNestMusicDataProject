Everything is so complex everyday is like a test
For the obstacles that I? m seem almost impossible
And I'm thinking, just another breath
Not a minute left, how long have I been drifting

Pass the glass pipe, hit the flashlight, now I break it
People say I'm a star, but I still think I'll never make it
And I'm thinking, just another prayer
Not a second left, I feel there's something missing

Sometimes I hate that chaos surrounds me
When all the answers that I seek are around me
Am I drowning? Am I fading away?
Or am I living up to all your dreams that made me this way?
Am I drowning? Am I drowning? Am I drowning? Am I drowning?

I've been to hell and back, looking for the answers to life
Looking at myself trying to get things right
And I'm feeling, just another breath
Not a minute left, I feel the darkness lifting
...
