Got a 5 in my pocket
Wanna buy me some gin
I drop a gas in the tank
Let me think it over again
Cuz I'd rather be drunk
And drive away from here
Than to be sober
So sober
Yeah

No friends coming through
I think I've lost them all
No man to take their place
So I decided to make this call, whoa ho
And I'd rather be drunk
On a cload away from here
I don't wanna be sober
No not sober, yeah

Broke and alone
...
