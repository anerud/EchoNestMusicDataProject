How can I forget the things that I, 
I still regret, I'm wasted
How can I forget the things that I, 
I still regret, I'm wasted

Digest this bitter pill, I close my eyes
Cold sweats, I feel the chill inside
I decend into the abyss of a sin
Recalled decisions that I made within
This sense of guilt
Building up deep inside
Respect of the man
I once knew slowly dies
...
