Sanity and insanity
Go together, hand in hand
But never be afraid
On which side of the line you stand

Take the power to get in control
It's you that rules your life
Break down the walls that are surrounding you
Be strong and change your life

Erase the rules that are set there to keep you down
Break down the chains that keep you to the ground
Erase, erase and follow me to where the real fun is

It is not a shame to be called insane
To go against, against the grain
Demand the right to set your rules
