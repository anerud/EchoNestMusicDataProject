Once upon a time when we were friends
I gave you my heart the story ends
No happy ever after now we're friends

Wish upon a star if that might help
The stars collide if you decide
Wish upon a star if that might help

What's it like to have loved and to lose her touch
What's it like to have loved and to lose that much

Well I hope and I pray that maybe someday
You'll walk in the room with my heart
Add and subtract but as a matter of fact
Now that you're gone I still want you back

Remembering
...
