Something about you
Makes me wanna keep on loving you
When I'm without you
I feel I need you back in my arms

I get a sensation
I feel whenever I'm around you
You're my inspiration
And I'm so glad I found you

One in a million, baby you're the one
One in a million, and you're second to none
One in a million, a million to one
You're one in a million

When I first saw you
I had a feeling right from the start
In love I was falling
You seemed to do things to my heart
