Warned, the voices I hear have warned me
The deepest lies adore you
And consume you in every way
You're giving us nothing

Decay! Cut the tongue you speak with to say
Don't believe, don't believe it
The wrong way, on a path to somewhere
Don't feed the selfish mouth of man

Born into a life that depletes me
Your empty words have burned you
...
