I tried not to write a song so sad
Baby we...
Have what you call unconditional, love
Far more than just beautiful, she
Added the sun to my cloudy day, way
Too strong to ever fade away, hey
Least it felt like that at the time, time
Never seemed to be a friend of mine, tho
I considered her my luck charm, she
Couldn't guide my heart away from harm no oh oh
[Chorus:]
I tried not to write a song so sad
When you gave all you had and it still goes bad
It's seems the pain just shows up on the, on the pad
As the pen just cries away

I try my best and even I, lie
...
