First, first time I look into your eyes
I saw heaven-oh-heaven in your eyes
Everything I did before you
Wasn't worth my time
It should've been you
You all the time
I do anything and everything
To please you
You know how much I need you
You're always always on my mind

You're more than wonderful
More than amazing
The irreplaceable love of my life
You're so incredible
Here in these arms of mine
The irreplaceable love of my life
...
