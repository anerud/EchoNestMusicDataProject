you tell me of a place
where everybody knew their neighbours
all the families helped each other
and no one ever locked their doors
you told me no one locked their doors

old man please stay a while
i know at first i seemed too busy
but now i'll make the time
stay and tell me one more story

tell me about the time
you ditched school to go fishing
you thought the branch would hold
your neighbour pulled you from the river
he helped you wash your clothes
and stich the hole in your trousers
...
