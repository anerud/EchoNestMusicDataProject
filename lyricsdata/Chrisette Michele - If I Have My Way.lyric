You're who I desire, you light my fire
With every kiss, you take me higher
Feeling like your lovin' I just cannot resist
There's something that's makin' me hold on
There's no one I'd rather share my good
lovin' with
But I promised I'd wait'til I'm ready for this

[Chorus:]
One day we'll make love, passion unheard of
I'll be your woman, if I have my way
We will see heaven, lovin' together
We won't stop ever, if I have my way
...
