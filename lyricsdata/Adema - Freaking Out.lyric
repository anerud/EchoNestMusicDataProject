I was such an outcast
No one ever liked me 'cause I wasn't wanted
I was so different from the rest of 'em all
Fucked up on the drugs
From all the speed
and I never got no sleep
'Cause I kept on tripping over what they said
And everything that my mom said made me mad

Why am I even trying?
I'm crying it out
I'm crying it out
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
Spinning 'round
I've fallen down
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out

You keep shooting those glances
Relating to the rawness of a fuckin lost kid
Trying so hard to become just like me
Talk like me
Walk like me
You keep tripping on everything i wear
Every time I swear
Even when it comes to my hair
