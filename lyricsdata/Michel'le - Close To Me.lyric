Hey hey what’s up baby
How you’re doing
Wait a minute what are you talking about you’re leaving
You can’t leave me
Don’t leave me
Come here, come here, where you’re going?
I’ve always liked that, all right

Ohh

Here I am lonely and waiting
Wondering where you go
And if you’re coming home
But you don’t care
Cause if you did you wouldn’t leave me
Sitting all alone like something that you owned
Every time I’m in need of some loving
...
