The walls are closing in around us
We hold our silence like a gun
Your stare is empty
And a scene that keeps repeating
And I just bite my tongue

They can't take this away, it's far from over
We can't stay in a place we don't belong
For one more day, I'm not afraid to fall
For one more day, we try to save it all

Footsteps will fade away the memories
Unload the words and breathe again
...
