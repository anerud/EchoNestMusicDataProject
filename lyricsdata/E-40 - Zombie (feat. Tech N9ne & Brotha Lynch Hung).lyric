If you're zombie, If you're zombie, monster, goon or fiend, If you're...
Lynch, E-40, It's that season of the sickness your witnessing nigga sittin spin, I'm a get you addicted when I spit shit venomous shit, shit again, Shit so much I gotta go to Costco to get my toilet paper, Hit so much, spit so much with the pistol up, I'm a skitzo nut, Zeppo rape or keep her safe or he could take her, Chill pill, real deal, kill bill, I'm might be sick, But that ain't the reason that I still spit real I'll, niggas ain't got no lyrics when I hear it I'm like "what's up with that" everybody wanna copy me, So I'm choppin em up leave rotten meat, (If you're zombie) I'm a be drama free like my momma be, Supersize before I let a nigga ride on me, that ain't comedy, I don't get, I don't have to get it, Mini AK, I call him midget, An he got a sister heatin em up makin his skin blister, I'm a monster your a zombie.
