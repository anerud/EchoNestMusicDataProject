I don't remember feeling like this...
Baby... Baby I love you... Baby... Baby I love you.

I got this jones forming in my bones (from a man),
who indeed took over my soul, (understand),
I couldn't breathe if he ever said (he would leave),
get on my knees till they bloody red, (baby please),
see I don't know if you get it yet (just don't know),
He's like a lighter to my cigarette(watch me smoke),
I never knew another human life(didn't know),
could have the power to take over mine,
So baby baby.

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby(baby I love you),
baby, baby, baby baby, baby,
I love it when I hear ya name,
got me sayin' baby, baby, baby,
baby, baby,(baby I love you)
baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.

See, I could never feel alone with you (in my life),
I'll give up everything I own for you (won't think twice),
...
