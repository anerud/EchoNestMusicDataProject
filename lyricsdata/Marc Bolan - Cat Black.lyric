Cat Black, you know she is back
Been six weeks since she blew her stack
Now she is fine, she's all mine
I'm gonna stop her blowing her mind again

Cat Black, she is my honey
All she wants to do is spend my money
She's a real gone chick and I love her so
Knocks me out when she does the rock 'n' roll, yeah

Cat Black, you know I'm pleased
Here's my heart and here's the keys to my Cadillac
Hey, Cat Black, you look all pretty
