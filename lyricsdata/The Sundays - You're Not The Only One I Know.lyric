Where's the harm in voicing a doubt
You'll find me in the lavatory
And where's the harm in talking out loud
When I'm on my own
What's so wrong with reading my stars
When I'll be in the lavatory
And what is so wrong with counting the cars
When I'm all alone

You're not the only one that I know
And I'm too proud to talk to you anyway
You're not the only one that I know
And I'm far too proud to talk to you any day
