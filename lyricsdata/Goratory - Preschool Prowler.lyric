I am the monster
In every children's nightmare
Their parent's fear provokes me into a frenzy! 

After preschool, Is it outside the parking lot
I see their parents I've seen their innocence... 
I like the bitches their hairless virgin untouched bodies give off a
Scent that drives me to a higher power
I change from sane to sickness, With plans to sodomize
Leaving toddlers screaming crying bleeding dying
...
