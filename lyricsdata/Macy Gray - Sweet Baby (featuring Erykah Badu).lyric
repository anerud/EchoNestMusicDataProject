Many times I've been told
that I should go
but they don't know
What we have baby
they may not see the Love in you
but Love I do
and I'll stay right here
Hmm, Sweet sweet Baby
Life is Crazy
but there's one thing
I am sure of
That I'm your Lady
Always Baby
and I'll Love you now and ever

Sugar wishes don't change what is Real
Or how it feels
In the Bad Times
for Whatever he is
He is Mine
All the Time
And we're Gettin' by
with our True Love
...
