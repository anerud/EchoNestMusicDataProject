And I pray salvation leaves you here
again
And if I swear for you, I've seen the end
I bear
This weight
For you
And now if seems to me
Every time that I try
To give you peace of mind,
You go and question why.
Some things you just should know
That it was yours to show
It's like I feel this way
Because I'm wanted to.
"and I pray for"
Weight
All of the weight
Can't stand the weight
Crushing
