It's all in your head the thoughts you have that build your world illusion,
the faith you need so you can proceed and build a sane solution
is it the truth, is there any proof to back up the things you believe in,
or is it a dream to make it seem like a goal that you're achieving

Chorus:
We are the prisoners,
of the system we create
We are the prisoners,
stuck inside the space we made
to escape
