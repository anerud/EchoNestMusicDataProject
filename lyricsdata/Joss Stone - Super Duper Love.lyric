Yeh are you diggin on me
Yeh yeh yeh
Im diggin on you now baby
Yeh do you wanna little bit of my love
Yeh wait a minute wait a minute

All the time i knew that you loved me
Because you were always there
Could i be that mistaken
Believing that you really care

In the presence of all my friends
You stood there holding my hand
And you promise me faithfully
That you will be my only man

Yeh are you diggin on me
Yeh yeh yeh
Im diggin on you now baby
Yeh do you wanna little bit of my love
