Some sunny day, baby
When everything seems okay, baby
You'll wake up and find that you're alone
â€~Cause I'll be gone
Gone, gone, gone
Really gone
Gone, gone, gone
â€~Cause you done me wrong
And everyone that you meet, baby
As you walk down the street, baby
Will ask you why you're walkin' all alone
And why you're on your own
And just say I'm gone
