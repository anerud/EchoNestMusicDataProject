I'll protect you from the hooded claw
Keep the vampires from your door
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Feels like fire
I'm so in love with you

Dreams are like angels
They keep bad at bay, bad at bay
Love is the light
Scaring darkness away, yeah

I'm so in love with you
Purge the soul
Make love your goal

The power of love
A force from above
Cleaning my soul
Flame on burnt desire
Love with tongues of fire
Purge the soul
Make love your goal
