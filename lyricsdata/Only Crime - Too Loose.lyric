oo many lies when I was seventeen
And now I'm keeping up time with you
Short sounds of apocalypse
And my world's torn out of view
It's always the same
They want to lock you down inside
They won't let you try

I realize it's all the same when the lights dim down to pray
Through the eyes we paralyze but the world won't stop today
