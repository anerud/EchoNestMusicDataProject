Let's play a game of truth or dare
Throw caution to the wind like we don't give a damn
I said me first it's fun to learn things new
I'm playing house in your backyard
And you don't stand a chance

Talk shout cat-fight show me what you got
'Cause I got the goods
Get the picture
Step aside
Take it like a man
