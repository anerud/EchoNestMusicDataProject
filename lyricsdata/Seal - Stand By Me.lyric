When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only
Only light we see

No, I won't be afraid
No no no no no no
No, I won't be afraid
Just as long, just as long
Just as long as you stand by me

Now darling, darling
Whenever I'm in trouble
Darling, won't you stand
I need just a little helping hand
Now now now
...
