You give him all your lovin', well
But you know you don't get that love in return, no
So how can I get you to know, well, well, well

Although you seen it comin', hey
Girl you just couldn't get that man to ever learn
So this time I hope you move on

You know that I'm what you're missin'
And you know that I'm good and it's good that you need
So please tell me baby

Can he love you like this
Can he give you the good lovin' you need
Top it off with a kiss
Can he make you go all night long?

Can he love you like this
Can he give you the good lovin' you need
Top it off with a kiss
Can he make you go all night long?

I know it might seem dirty
But I'll do what I gotta do just to make you mine
And it was always a matter of time, yeah oh yeah

You see, I know you want me
