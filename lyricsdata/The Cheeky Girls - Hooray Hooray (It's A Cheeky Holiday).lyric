Intro
Cheeky Holiday
(Hi de hi de ho)
Come and dance with us (Hi de hi de ho)

Verse
The sea and sun, is hot and fun
(Hi de hi de ho)
And the lazy days, to sing and laugh
(Hi de hi de ho)
You stretch and feel, the sand and sea
(Hi de hi de ho)
And the rhythm of the waves is what we hear
(Hi de hi de ho)

Chorus 1
Hooray, Hooray, its a holi-holiday,
All the girls and boys are out to play
(Holi-holiday)
