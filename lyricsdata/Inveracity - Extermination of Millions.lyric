I crave extermination of countless million human trash
I will be convinced if i only watch them lay down dead
It's time for all to see my unstoppable delirium of murder
Nothing but my only way to be set free
I live just to see to fulfill my desire
Extermination - scum of the earth
Extermination- genocide
Fucked up - this hallucination becomes a reality I'd never believe
