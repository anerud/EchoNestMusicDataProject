You say I'm paranoid
Isn't that what you said
You say it's my imagination
And I'm fucked in the head
P-p-p-paranoid
And it's easy to see
Well is it really paranoia
Or is somebody after me
Is this going down
Or is it
Para-fuckin-noia driving me insane
Para-fuckin-noia ripping up my brain
Is it para-fuckin-noia making me believe
It's either para-fuckin-noia
Or somebody's after me
P-p-p-paranoid
