Walk around so cold
So cold and lonely
Or lay in bed wondering what
To do with time
You've got no sense of fun
Until you know you've won again
And yet you feel so much
You feel so much inside
You want to rip all the
Jewels off all the idiots' backs so badly
You scream give me what I've always
Missed, give me a good time
But if you look into your mirror
You'll see that nobody has ever ripped you off
It's all in your mind
...
