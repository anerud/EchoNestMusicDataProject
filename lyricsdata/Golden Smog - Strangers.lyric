Where are you going, I don't mind
I'll kill my world and I'll kill my time
So where do I go, what do I see
See many people coming out to me

So where are you going to, I don't mind
If I live too long I'm afraid I'll die
So I will follow you wherever you go
If your offered hand is still open to me

Strangers on this road, we are all
We are not two, we are one
