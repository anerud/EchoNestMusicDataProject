You must never forget, the essence of your spark,
All of which that defines you is the essence of your blood...
The infection has been removed, the soul of this machine has improved
The infection has been removed, the soul of this machine has improved

Look in to my eyes and tell me what you see
Someone real?
This is real!
What you wish to be!

You must never forget to modernize performance
