Called you for the first time yesterday
I finally found the missing part of me
I felt so close but you were far away
Left me without anything to say

Now I'm speechless over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again

I can't get your smile out of my mind
