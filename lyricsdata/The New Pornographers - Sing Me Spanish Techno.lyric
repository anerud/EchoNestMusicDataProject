Go to now after picking the glass off the ground.
Go to now after shaking the thing for a sound.
Do we see what the clock makes you do?
But I won't let this happen to you.

In a town where I lost every shirt on the fence.
Go to now, I am bleeding a trail through the lens.
When I see what I now know is you, I was caught in the eye as you came.
Pulled by my name, I'm fallin' through.

Traveling at godspeed over the hills and trails.
I have refused my call pushin' my lazy cells.
Into the blue flame, I want to crash here right now.
