She's got diamonds in her eyes
That she likes to hide
Seek and you will find
The hide and seeking kind

She's got rings
Wrapped around her precious things
And what the day brings
Oh, it's no surprise

Don't you ask me how I'm doing
When everything I do says missing you
Don't you ask me how I'm doing
When everything I do, when everything I do
When everything I do says I miss you
