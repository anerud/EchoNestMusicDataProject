Hate, something, sometime, someway
Something kicked down the football
Mine, something inside.
I'll never ever follow.
So give... me... some... thing... that... is... for... real.
I'll never ever follow.

Get your boogie on.
Get your boogie on.

Hate, something, someway, each day
Feeling ripped off again no.
Why? This shit inside.
Now everyone will follow.
So give... me... noth... ing... just... feel.
And all the shit will follow.

God thanks me
The more I see the lie.
Who wants to see?
God told me
I've already Got The Life
Oh, I say...
...
