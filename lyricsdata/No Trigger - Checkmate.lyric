talk about a never-ender
towed along against the weeds and dredging shallows
this could be the worst deal ever
say it like you mean it I will not be defeated
we're on the bus on the street on the beach they're looking back
you're watching over me
with groceries and coffee beans the dishes clean I rinse repeat
until the ghosts swallow the daylight
