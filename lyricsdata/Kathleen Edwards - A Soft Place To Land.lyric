Calling it quits
You think this is easy
I swear I hurt
You call in the jury
Call it a catch
Without any strings attached

Well I'm looking for a soft place to land
The forest floor
The palms of your hands
I'm looking for a soft place to land

I call it an ace
You've gotta believe me
But you're calling me names
...
