Here we go

Chorus:
Life is a blast when you know what you're doin
Best to know what you're doin 'fore your life get ruined
Life is a thrill when your skill is developed
If you ain't got a skill or trade, then shut the hell up

Verse One:
My rhymes is like droppin your head on cement
Crackin it open hopin to make a dent; I'm hell-bent on
resurrection, per-fection
Lesson #1: rekindle the essence
Rap ain't about bustin caps and fucking bitches
It's about fluency with rhymin ingenuity
All of this is new to me, see I peep rhymes
with scrutiny, under a microscope I walk a tightrope
A thin line between insanity and sanity
mixed with a little vanity, boostin the morality
with Hiero hospitality, soon to strike it: rich
like calories, salaries, ahh sounds like a plan
And, I will expand hip-hop as well
Might even kick a little impromptu, to stomp you
weaklings, speaking things foreign to the human ear
that you will fear now, whether you like it or not
Blood clots on you little life on the situation
and on the stipulations... the shit you wastin
time on you pawns, it was planned like that
But we can fight back, like David Horowitz
...
