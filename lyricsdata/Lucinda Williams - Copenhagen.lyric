Thundering news hits me like a snowball
struck in my face and shattering
Covering me in a fine powder and mist
and mixing in with my tears

And I'm 57 but I could be 7 years old,
Cos I will never be able
to comprehend the expansiveness
of what I've just learned

But you, have disappeared
You have been released
You are flecks of light
...
