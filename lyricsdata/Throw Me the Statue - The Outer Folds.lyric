Humid longing in the street
Creatures chewing at their needs
The breeze in cuffs can eat you up, easy when you're young
And you're tired of taking, take what you get

living glamors up a hill
Just to roll you back down, so you ge the feel
Again it's your pride that pays, more than you'll every think
The chewing gum believers drone

Can you return that stare?
Can you maintain that whole?

Bag it happy as we came
At the dawn we died again
Sometimes the general pace, seems like some great escape
...
