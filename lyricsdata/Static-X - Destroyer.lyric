Take it down with a steam hammer
Pack it hard
Lead shot in your mood shooter
Choose your poison
Have a drink with your painkiller
Take us down

Wreck a party like it don't matter
Smash it up
Dead guitar
Broken beat maker
If I could I'd trade it all for an automator
Here it comes

Oh, you do it again
