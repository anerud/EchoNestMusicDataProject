Carolers singing
Sleigh bells are ringing
It's that time of year
Everyone's toasting
Chestnuts are roasting
Christmas time is near

Something's missing and I'm wishing
Wishing that you knew
How much it would mean to spend this
Christmas time with you
So if you feel it coming
On this special day
Just trust your heart
Don't let your head get in the way
