The first time I gazed upon that glorious thing 
It made we wanna dance and delightfully sing
I whirled and twirled and laughed til I cried, 
I was so ecstatic until I realized
It was not mine nor would it ever be.
Then a storm of emotion swept over me
My heart was broken,
My hands were tied, 
my one desire had been denied

I Want It So Bad 
I Want It So Bad 
I Want It So Bad 
I Want It So Bad 

Maybe it’s a dream, maybe it’s a thing, 
...
